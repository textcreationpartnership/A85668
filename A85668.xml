            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Hebrew is, I Jehovah your God. The firſt is abſolute, the ſecond relative. Of Jehovah I have ſpoken heretofore, it notes Gods nature and being, which is of its ſelf, within its ſelf, and dependent upon none; all other beings are from him, and depend on him, according to what you have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. of him, through him, and to him are all things, and <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>in him we live, move, and have our beings.</hi>

               <q>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:118926:14"/>Your God.</q>
               <p>This is a great word, and hath great mercy in it; an ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word, tying God and all his attributes to them, your God to counſell you, your God to protect you, your God to deliver you, your God to comfort you, your God to plead for you, your God to teach you, your God to ſet up my name and worſhip among you, your God to bleſs you with the dews of heaven, and fulneſs of the earth, your God to hear your prayers, and to make you happy.</p>
               <p>While they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God profeſſed himſelf to bee their God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.7. <hi>I will take you to mee for a people, and I will bee to you a God, and yee ſhall know that I am the Lord your God.</hi> Hee would not bee a Titular God unto them, like the Heathens Gods, but they ſhould have experience of him, and his Attributes, hee would do by them, and for them, as a God in Covenant.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>There bee times when the Lord is pleaſed to ſhew mercy to people in miſery and great afflictions.</hi> In the day that I choſe thee; <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in a diſtreſſed condition in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in a very low eſtate. Their lives were imbittered with hard bondage, inſomuch that they ſighed and cryed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.23. and now at this time, and being in this condition, God heard their groanings, looked upon, and had reſpect unto them, now hee choſe them, <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25. therefore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>cha.</hi> 48.10. <hi>God choſe them in the furnace of affliction;</hi> times of miſery, are times of Gods ſhewing mercy; when they were in a hot fiery furnace, ready to bee conſumed to aſhes, no likely-hood of eſcaping, yet even then did the Lord appear and manifeſt his choice of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. when this people were in their bloud, filth, nakedneſs, ſaith God, I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, and behold thy time was the time of love, I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. at that time God took this people into favour. God hath his day to bind up the breach of his people, and to heal the ſtroak of their wound, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.26. <hi>Hoſea</hi> tells you, that after two daies hee will revive his people, and in the third day raiſe them up; though they bee like men dead and buried, yet God hath his time to revive, raiſe; and to cauſe to live in his ſight. They were as dry bones in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:118926:14"/> and ſerved a hard ſervice there; but there was a day wherein God gave them reſt from their ſorrow, fears, and ſervitude, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.3, 4. The Gentiles were a long time in the wilderneſſe, in a loſt and periſhing condition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. there was a time they were without Chriſt, without hope, without God in the world, but God had a day to manifeſt his choice of them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. but now in Chriſt Jeſus they who were ſometimes a farre off, are made nigh, there was a now, a time, a day for them. So <hi>Zeph</hi> 3.16.19, 20.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The taking of a people to be the Lords, is of meer grace and mercy.</hi> It is Gods own free act. <hi>In the day when I choſe Iſrael, Iſrael</hi> did not chuſe him, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had nothing to affect him, but out of his good pleaſure hee choſe <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The Lord makes open proteſtation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. that hee did not ſet his love upon them, nor chuſe them, becauſe they were more in number, than other people, but becauſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; and what made God love them, were they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other Nations? they came of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Hittites,</hi> they were in their bloud, when hee ſaid unto them, <hi>Live, Ezek.</hi> 16.3, 6. did hee foreſee they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, repent, and perſevere in keeping his commands, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him above the reſt of the world? no, hee foreſaw, that they would bee more wicked than the Nations and Countries round about them, <hi>Eze.</hi> 5.6, 7. and exceed <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Samaria</hi> in wickedneſſe, as it is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.47, 51, 52. what was it then cauſed God to love &amp; chuſe this people? nothing without God himſelf, all was within doors, that ſtirred him up to do it. I will ſay to them which were not my people, thou art my people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23. Gods will is the cauſe, and nothing elſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. <hi>Hee will have mercy, on whom hee will, Iſa.</hi> 41.9. <hi>I have choſen thee, and not caſt thee away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>When Gods people are in troubles, he diſcovers and reveales himſelf unto them, one way or other, by one means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I made my ſelf known unto them in the land of Egypt,</hi> that was a land and houſe of bondage to them, they met with reproaches, threats, ſtripes, rigour, and hard labour there, and when the caſe was ſo with them, then God unmaskes, and ſhews himſelf unto them. When <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren were in great trouble, then hee made known himſelf unto
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118926:15"/> them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. and ſo did God unto his people by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> hee made known what Promiſe and Oath hee had made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> hee made known his tender-heartedneſſe to them, that their cries came up to his ears, and that he was affected with their ſorrows, and would no longer indure the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to oppreſs them; he made known his mighty power unto them, that hee was ſtronger than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his ſtrength, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.34, 35. hath God aſſayed to go and take him a Nation from the middeſt of another Nation, by temptations, by ſigns, and by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by warre, by a mighty hand, by a ſtretched out arm, and by great terror? according to all that the Lord your God did for you in <hi>Egypt</hi> before your eyes, unto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord hee is God. The Lord made himſelf known by theſe in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner unto them. It is Gods way and wont to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to his in the time of their calamitie and darkneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.11, 12, 13, 14. O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted: Behold, I will lay thy ſtones with fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and lay thy foundations with Saphires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will make thy windows of Agates, and thy gates of Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and all thy borders of pleaſant ſtones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all thy Children ſhall bee taught of the Lord, and great ſhall bee the peace of thy Children, in righteouſneſſe ſhalt thou be eſtabliſhed, &amp;c.</hi> What a precious glorious diſcovery of God was here unto the Church being in a ſtorm? So when <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> wept for her Children, and refuſed to bee comforted, becauſe they were not, how did the Lord break out of the Clouds and ſhine, when hee ſaid to her, <hi>refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ſaith the Lord, and they ſhall come again from the land of the enemie.</hi> In the time of affliction Gods words, and works are more obſerved, take deeper impreſſion, indear more unto him, therefore hee loves to manifeſt himſelf in them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God knowing mens weakneſſe, condiſcends for to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and eſtabliſh them in the aſſurance of his favour towards them.</hi> Not onely by word and works did God evidence it, that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were his choſen ones,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118926:15"/> his people, which might have ſufficed; but hee took his oath on't: I lifted up my hand unto the ſeed of the houſe of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> yea, that it might bee the more firm, hee doubled it. <hi>When I lifted up my hand unto them, Saying, I am the Lord your God.</hi> For God to tell any people hee hath choſen them, argues great favour, then, to appear unto them, and make large manifeſtations of himſelf, and his good will unto them, by words, providentiall, and wonderful working for them, argues more and more favour; and then to ſwear unto them, or declare, hee hath ſworn unto them, and not onely to do ſome few things for them, but to bee their God, this is height of favour, wonderful ſtooping on Gods part; and this hee did to confirm their hearts in aſſurance of his love. God cannot falſify his word, much leſſe his Oath. God did ſwear, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed might have ſtrong conſolation, not ſtagger, queſtion his love any more; and the Apoſtle applies it to himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. to all beleevers who are heirs of the promiſe, and under the oath of God, that we might have ſtrong conſolation.</p>

               <p>In the Preface to the Ten Commandements you have theſe words, <hi>I am the Lord thy God;</hi> which is a ſtrong reaſon why they ſhould have no other Gods before him, and ſo here, are the reaſon why they ſhould caſt away their Idols, and not defile themſelves any more with them. The ſtrength of the argument runnes thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am the Lord of all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118926:21"/> creatures, it belongs to mee to give Lawes, and command what I pleaſe.

Superſtition, Idolatry, and prophaneneſſe, are prevalent things. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf the Sonne of <hi>David,</hi> was caught in this ſnare, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. it is ſaid of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they mingled among the Heathen and learned their works, yea, ſerved their Idols, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.35, 36. by dwelling amongſt them, they were transformed into their likeneſs, what they ſaw them do, they did, what they ſaw them worſhip, they worſhipped; the Heathens ſerved Idols, or Griefes; as <hi>Montanus</hi> hath it, becauſe Idols cauſe grief; and the Hebrewes ſerved Idols, which brought grief and vexation. There is a ſecret, but ſtrong power in all wickedneſſe to aſſimilate, and few who dwell neer her borders, eſcape ſubſcription to her Laws, and practiſes. When <hi>Dinah</hi> went out to ſee the Daughters of the Land, ſhee was caught and defiled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.1, 2. and when men go not onely to ſee, but to converſe with, and live amongſt the Daughters of a Land, <hi>viz.</hi> the corrupt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and practiſes thereof, they are in great danger to bee caught and corrupted.

He took them unto himſelf, having taken them out of the hands of the Egyptian Tyrants, and Task-maſters, he put them not under the power of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but took them to himſelf, hee became their Lord and Soveraigne, they took not him, but hee took them.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Such is the corruption of mens natures, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the more mercies and means they have, the worſe they grow.</hi> This People had variety of mercies, and every mercy ſhould have led them to repentance, according to that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. eſpecially ſuch mercies as they had; but above all, Gods ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to them ſhould have done it: how hee ſpake to them in <hi>Egypt</hi> wee finde not, no Prophets are mentioned to have been there before <hi>Moſes.</hi> Whither hee ſpake himſelf unto them, or by Angels, or by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or ſome others, he did ſpeak, <hi>but they rebelled and hearkned not,</hi> their corrupt hearts and natures degenerated more and more. The Jews who had the pleaſant land, the Prophets, Temple, Oracles, and Ordinances of God, grew worſe than any of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.47. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. It is obſervable, that men living in the Chriſtian world, and where beſides a multitude of other mercies, they have the Goſpel to do them good, to draw them to God, to direct and inable them to work righteouſneſſe, and go beyond Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in all things, yet in many things they fall ſhort of them, ſome of them, and diverſe in many things are worſe than the worſt of them. If mercies and means prove not the ſavour of life, they ripen and perfect mens corruptions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſavour of death: was there heard of amongſt the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118926:25"/> Heathens, ſuch a wretch as <hi>Judas</hi> was, who betrayed ſuch a Maſter as hee did? <hi>Chorazin, Bethſaida,</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> were the more unhappy, and expoſed to the deeper condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe they had more mercy and means.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Not doing what God commands, is not hearkening, and not hearkening, is rebellion.</hi> They <hi>rebelled</hi> and would not <hi>hearken</hi> unto mee, they did not caſt away the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their eyes, nor forſake the Idols of <hi>Egypt.</hi> They <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled,</hi> becauſe they <hi>hearkened not,</hi> they <hi>hearkened not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>did not;</hi> its like they heard God commanding, but hearing, and not doing, they did not hearken. Doing, is knowing of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.16. and doing is hearkening to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9. but not doing, is not hearkening, and not hearkening is <hi>rebellion;</hi> hence not doing is called <hi>rebelling</hi> againſt the command of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.26. going <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Jer.</hi> 7.24. <hi>rejecting</hi> of the words and Law of God, <hi>chap.</hi> 6.19. <hi>hardening</hi> of the neck, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Our fathers dealt proudly, hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandements,</hi> its pride and hardneſſe of heart, not to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto God and his commands.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Mens not hearkening unto God, puts him upon thoughts and purpoſes of puniſhing them, and that ſeverely: Then I ſaid I will pour out my fury upon them,</hi> and accompliſh conſummate, perfect mine anger againſt them. <hi>Then,</hi> when they would not do as I bid them, I had thoughts and reſolutions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. When the glorious, great, and onely wiſe God, ſhall ſpeak to the creature, to do that which tends to its great good, and ſhall not bee heard but diſobeyed and ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this provokes God, and procreates <hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> when they hearkned not, but ſinn'd ſo in the buſineſs of the calfe, it was in the heart of God utterly to deſtroy them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them and not onely them, but their name from under heaven, Deu.</hi> 9.14. had not <hi>Moſes</hi> poured water upon this fire and quenched it, hee had done it, they had no longer been a people, nor had any memorial left of them; of this ſpeaks <hi>David; Pſal.</hi> 106.23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid that he would deſtroy them, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> his choſen ſtood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath, leaſt hee ſhould deſtroy
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118926:25"/> them. This is ſpoken of God after the manner of men; when they are offended, they purpoſe and reſolve to deſtroy thoſe have provoked them, but ſome friend interpoſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with them, and prevents them, as <hi>Abigail</hi> did <hi>David;</hi> ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> here prevented the Lord by his prayers, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, from deſtroying this people; Mens perverſe dealings with God, do put him upon intentions of their ruine, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.16. <hi>I ſaid I would ſcatter them into Corners, and would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe from among men.</hi>

It was no ſmall mercy that God gave them <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgements;</hi> for no Nation had the like mercy. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, that hath Statutes and Judgements ſo righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as all this Law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> ſaid <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to them. Other Nations had their Statutes and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but either they were not righteous, or at beſt not ſo righteous as theirs were; if ſome were righteous others were not; Here all were righteous, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.128. They are called <hi>judgements of righteouſneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 119.7. and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> that are <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 172. They are the judgements, and commands of the righteous God, they are full of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and make men righteous. If the Law of the twelve Tables among the Romans did exceed all the libraries of Philoſophers in weight and worth, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, what then did the <hi>Statutes and Judgements</hi> God gave to this people? they exceeded all the Laws that ever were or ſhall be; this made <hi>David</hi> to value them above <hi>thouſands of Gold and Silver,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118926:31"/> Pſal.</hi> 119.72. and to pray unto the Lord to open his eyes, that hee might ſee the <hi>myſteries and depths</hi> were in them; verſ. 18. and 129. and that he would incline his heart to keep them, verſ. 36. God gave them theſe Laws to ſhew that hee would bee their governour, that they ought to obey him; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Law-giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>The great bounty and wiſdome of God in making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of an happy life here, and eternal life hereafter, to the keepers of the Law, to thoſe ſhould obſerve his Statutes and Judgements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 His <hi>great bounty:</hi> for ſuppoſe a man could perfectly in all things keep the Law, and that perpetually, he deſerves nothing thereby, being Gods creature, its his duty to do what hee appoints and commands, mans works do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, nor carry that intrinſecal worth before God as to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at his hands; the life therefore attainable hereby is <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one pacti &amp; promiſſi,</hi> not from the nature of mans obedience but of Gods promiſe; and ſo is from his bounty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will; For God to promiſe life to mans obedience was great mercy, tranſcending what ever poſſibly, or imaginably could bee therein, whereas hee might have commanded all man could do without any promiſe of life at all; neither let any ſay, this Promiſe was to no purpoſe, becauſe man was not able to keep the Law. The fault thereof was not in God, nor in the Law, but in man himſelf, who had diſabled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and here appears,</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Great wiſdome</hi> of God, that made this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life to the keepers of the Law, that ſo hee might draw out their indeavours to the utmoſt, and that ſeeing when they were at the height they fell ſhort of that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law required, they might look for life upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> the righteouſneſſe of faith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.12, 13, 14, 15. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31, 32. and ch. 10.5, 6, 7, 8.

               <p>To this inquiry, the Anſwer is; that they had the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> before that time of <hi>Moſes</hi> giving the Law at Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> as appears <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23, 25, 26. <hi>On the Sabbath day there was no manna to bee found or gathered,</hi> and Gen. 2.3. <hi>God bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſeventh day and ſanctified it,</hi> ſurely this bleſſing and ſanctifying of it was for mans uſe, God needed no day: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. hee ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath given you the Sabbath,</hi> alluding to the firſt inſtitution: and the word <hi>Remember,</hi> which beginnes the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, imports that the day was given before, though much forgotten and neglected.

               <p>There is no mention of keeping it in <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> in <hi>Judges,</hi> in <hi>Samuel,</hi> is it therefore a warrantable, or good argument, to conclude that it was not kept? yea, if it were granted

               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> were given before, how are they ſaid to be given when they were in the wilderneſs? this is anſwered in the next words.</p>
               <q>To be a ſign between me and them.</q>
               <p>The firſt giving of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was to bee a <hi>memoriall</hi> of the <hi>Creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen.</hi> 2.3. and therefore was obſerved by the Primitive Fathers, whom the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World did moſt nearly concern, and was in uſe before <hi>Moſes</hi> daies, who was above two thouſand years after: But when God gave it out again by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it was upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> to bee a <hi>ſign</hi> between him and his people the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that upon the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> obſerves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſign]</hi> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a <hi>ſigne</hi> of the true Sabbath, wherein we ſhall reſt from the labour of this world, So <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> a ſign of love and reconciliation, ſo <hi>Vatablus;</hi> a <hi>ſigne</hi> of Holineſſe, that by the time dedicated to God, we might know our ſelves dedicated to God, So <hi>Cajetane;</hi> a <hi>ſign</hi> of difference between the Jews and all other People, who were prophane, and derided the Jews for looſing the ſeventh part of their time, So <hi>Toſtat.</hi> and <hi>Sanctius.</hi> They were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other Nations by Circumciſion, and by meats; but theſe were not ſo viſible, obſervable in the eye of the world as their <hi>Sabbaths.</hi> A <hi>ſign</hi> that God had taken this people to himſelf, ſeparated them from <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and others, and would have them in a ſpecial manner remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their <hi>Egyptian deliverance,</hi> on that day, as formerly the <hi>Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was a ſign between God and them, they glorified him, owning him for their God, and he ſanctified them, owning them for his people: So that here was a ſecond edition, and as it were a new inſtitution of the <hi>Sabbath. Becauſe hee brought them out of</hi> Egypt <hi>with a mighty hand, therefore hee commanded them to keep the Sabbath, Deut.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:118926:33"/>I am the Lord which ſanctify them.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanctifying</hi> as it referres to God, notes ſometimes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſome ſpecial ſervice, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.27, 28. <hi>Prepare the Nations againſt them,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>Sanctify the nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her;</hi> that is, <hi>Babylon;</hi> preparing of the Nations to the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is ſanctifying of them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it notes ſeparation to an holy uſe, as <hi>Joel</hi> 1.14. <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy yee a fast,</hi> that is, ſeparate a time from common imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Religious; So Chriſt is ſaid to bee ſanctifyed, <hi>John.</hi> 10.36.

               <p>I have given them my holy-daies; times ſeparated from all Common uſe, and worldly imployments; times for drawing near to, and worſhipping of mee; times wherein they ought to bee holy, and to minde holy things; and ſo know that it is I which ſeparate them from others, and do make them holy, a peculiar People unto my ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether was not the Sabbath a mutable Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſeeing he calls it a <hi>ſign</hi> here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That proves it not to bee ſo, for <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.12. the Rain-bow is called a <hi>Token or ſign</hi> between God and man, and that was no mutable Ceremony, but continues to the end of the World. Beſides, its not a <hi>ſign</hi> or type of future Grace, ſomething to come, but <hi>a ſigne</hi> of their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or of the Creation, which were things paſt, or <hi>a ſigne</hi> of Gods ſanctifying them at the preſent, when they met before him on thoſe daies. And further, <hi>ſigne</hi> here, by ſome is put, for <hi>argumentum</hi> or <hi>documentum,</hi> its a note of your diſtinction from others, of your being my people, and of my ſanctifying of you.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>When God is in a way of mercy with a people, hee hath his moreovers: Moreover I gave unto them my Sabbaths,</hi> Neh. 9. hee reckons up many mercies, and verſ. 22. hee ſaith, <hi>Moreover thou gaveſt them kingdomes and nations,</hi> ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. hee tells them of what mercies they ſhall have, and verſ. 26. <hi>Moreover the light of the Moon ſhall be as the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118926:33"/> light, &amp;c.</hi> God doth alwaies perform his promiſes, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his faithfulneſſe, and many times hee gives more than he promiſes, good meaſure, preſſed down, and running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to ſhew his bountifulneſs.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That of holy times, and daies, God is the Author: I gave them my Sabbaths:</hi> God bleſſed and ſanctified the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, and gave it unto the Jews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. it is his prerogative to make perſons, things, or times, holy: it is not in the power of man or any ſort of men, to make days holy. It was no ſmall ſin, in our fore-fathers, that took upon them to make Lent and other times holy, and ſome daies more holy than the Lords day it ſelf. The Jewes had no holy daies, but at the Lords appointment.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The Lord gave forth and appointed holy and reſting daies, upon weighty and conſiderable grounds, alwaies after ſome great mercy, ſome ſpecial thing or other which hee had done;</hi> As here, when hee had brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> drowned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt in the deeps, then hee gave them out the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath again. At firſt it was inſtituted after that great and glorious work of the Creation; God would have great works and mercies to bee kept in memory; So the day wee keep was appointed in memorial of that great work, mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore is honoured with the Title of <hi>Lords Day, Rev.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>The Sabbath is a day of ſpecial concernment to God and his people: I gave them my Sabbaths to bee a ſigne between mee and them.</hi> As the Rain-bow is a ſign of ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment between God and the world, ſo is the Sabbath. Its an argument and evidence that God looks upon them as his People, where his Sabbath is, and that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God their God, who keep his Sabbaths; By it God keeps alive the memory of his glorious, great, and gratious works, and by it the people are brought to glorify and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his name for thoſe works, by it hee diſtinguiſheth his people from the Prophane, and by it they diſtinguiſh him from the Idol gods; in it the Lord ſanctifies his People, and they in it do worſhip him, its the day wherein they meet, viſit, and make each other cheerful and glorious, let us
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118926:34"/> have more honourable thoughts of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and not think it concernes not us; if wee bee his people, its ſtill a <hi>ſigne</hi> between him and them.</p>
               <p>If wee have no <hi>Sabbath,</hi> or no day anſwerable to it, wee come ſhort of the Jews, who had it given unto them as a great mercy. <hi>I gave unto them my Sabbaths,</hi> my holy reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daies.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>Sanctification is the work of the Lord, and ſpecially of the Lord, when people meet on his day.</hi> Hee gave them his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and they were called <hi>holy Convocations,</hi> becauſe on them the people met, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.3. and why did hee give them thoſe daies? that they might know that hee was the Lord which <hi>ſanctified</hi> them. There is none which can <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify</hi> perſons by way of ſeparation or inherent holineſſe, but the Lord. Hee aſſumes this power and priviledge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.28. and his <hi>ſanctifying</hi> is chiefly when People meet on his day. Then the Law was read and opened unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8. then did God appear amongſt them, and work by the means hee appointed for their <hi>ſanctification. Pſal.</hi> 89.7. God is greatly to bee feared in the Aſſembly of Saints, there hee convinces them of their ſinfulneſſe, and ſinful practiſes, there hee beats down their ſtrong holds, and captivates their thoughts, to the obedience of his will; what was it made <hi>David</hi> openly to proclaim it, that a day in Gods Court was better than a thouſand; one <hi>Sabbath</hi> day wherein hee had communion with God, and found him <hi>ſanctifying</hi> his head and heart, was more eſteemed of him than a thouſand other daies: for the Lord ſaith hee is a <hi>ſunne and a ſhield,</hi> hee inlightens mee, hee ſtrengthens mee, and ſo ſeparates my darkneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from mee, and makes mee more holy: Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look unto God alone for <hi>ſanctification,</hi> and wait upon him on his daies in the ſolemn aſſemblies, and hee will <hi>ſanctify</hi> us, thoſe are daies of his ſpecial preſence, power, and bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 6 <hi>Gods people ſhould obſerve and take notice what God doth in them, on Sabbaths, when they appear before him:</hi> they had the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> given them, that they might know the Lord did ſanctify them, that they might have experience in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:118926:34"/> themſelves, of the powerfull operations of God in them: God obſerved what they did that day, and they were to obſerve what hee did that day; They read the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and expounded them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.8. they Prayed, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.13. they diſcourſed, reaſoned, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded men out of the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.4. they offered Sacrifices, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28.2.10. they did ſing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92. the Title. Theſe things they did, and God obſerved their ſpirits in the doing of them; hee obſerved how they ſanctifyed the day and himſelf, in the duties of the day; and they were to obſerve what hee did in the Aſſemblies, and in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes. This <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96.6. <hi>ſtrength and beauty are in his Sanctuary,</hi> ſaith he, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 63.2. hee confeſſes hee had ſeen Gods <hi>Power</hi> and glory there; the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in one place, is the ſame with <hi>Power</hi> in the other; its a glorious beautiful work, when God ſanctifies a ſinner, its a work of Power and ſtrength, when hee breaks the ſnares of our luſts, the chains of unbeleef, and inlarges our hearts, quickens, comforts, ſtrengthens and inlightens us. Its a common ſin, and ſickneſſe amongſt Chriſtians, that they heed not what the Lord does in his Ordinances for them, and in them: they cannot ſay from experience, wee know it is the Lord that ſanctifies us, moſt can ſay this from the Tongue, few from the heart; 'twas not without cauſe, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God, and bee more near to hear, than to offer the ſacrifice of Fools, Eccl.</hi> 5.1. ſome thinke hee alludes to <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5.30.19. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5. laſt. Where is mention of putting off their ſhooes, and waſhing their feet, becauſe they were to approach unto the holy God, and ſurely wee had need look to our feet; that is, our affection (foot is put for feet, the ſingular for the plural) for we approach near to God when we go to his houſe; wee go to be ſanctified, and therefore ſhould take heed we defile not our ſelves.</p>

               <p>But here a difficulty ariſeth in the 6. verſ. of this Chapter, its ſaid that God had <hi>lift up his hand,</hi> and ſo ſworn to bring them not onely out of <hi>Egppt,</hi> but into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and here its ſaid, hee had <hi>lift up his hand</hi> to the contrary, that

               <p>This difficulty is removed, by conſidering, that God did not make promiſe, or ſwear to thoſe individual men that were kept out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they ſhould bee brought into it, if it had been ſo, God had forgot and forſworn himſelf: but his Promiſe and Oath was, that the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould bee brought into it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.7. <hi>ch.</hi> 13.15. <hi>ch.</hi> 15.18. <hi>ch.</hi> 26.4. <hi>ch.</hi> 50.24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.4. and their ſeed was brought into the Promiſed Land, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.2. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 14.1.24.13. and ſo Gods Promiſe and Oath was kept.

               <p>The 19. verſ. you have <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.4, 5. <hi>I am the Lord your God, ye ſhall therefore keep my Statutes and my Judgements.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe verſes requires explication. Take theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Children are prone to follow the corrupt decrees, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and examples of their parents. I ſaid walk not in the ſtatutes of your fathers.</hi> That is, in what they decree, appoint; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not their judgements, that is, their Counſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſements; nor defile your ſelves with their Idols, that is, follow not their examples. They were addicted much to what their ſinful Fathers ſaid, or did. Of the Kings of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> its ſaid, they did evil as their Fathers had done, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.9. <hi>ch.</hi> 23.32. <hi>ch.</hi> 24.9. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. the Children would ſacrifice to, and defile themſelves with Idols, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Poſterity are not tyed to the ſtatutes and Judgements of their Fathers or fore-fathers.

Here is Divine authority for it, <hi>I ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it bee Gods Command that lead Children to obey Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and People to obey Magiſtrates in Lawful things, then Gods prohibition muſt keep them from obeying in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful things: When Maſters or Parents are ſo wicked, as to put their Servants or Children upon lying or ſwearing, to put off their commodities, they ſhould remember what God hath ſaid, <hi>Walk not in their ſtatutes. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This holds eſpecially in matters of Faith and worſhip, mens
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118926:39"/> ſtatutes and judgements muſt not come in there: what is not Divine, is no matter for my faith, nor rule for my worſhip; Mens chaffe and bran muſt not come among Gods wheat; their weeds and nettles muſt not come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his flowers; It is not Popes decrees, Canons of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, judgements of Fathers, Votes of Synods, Cuſtomes of Churches, Religion of Aunceſtors, that muſt tye my Conſcience, or guide my practice in the worſhip of God. He hath ſaid it, who is above them all, <hi>Walk not in their ſtatutes, neither obſerve their Judgements, and defile not your ſelves with their Idols.</hi> Men have their Statutes, their judgements, their inventions and additions to points of Faith, and matters of worſhip, which are no other than Idols, and will defile.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Having and hallowing Gods Sabbaths, is a ſign and manifeſtation that God is the God of that people.</hi> The Jews had the <hi>Lords Sabbaths,</hi> and hee bad them <hi>hallow</hi> them, that ſo being hallowed, they might ſignify and certify to them, that God was their God.

When God told them, <hi>Hee that killed an Oxe, was as if he flew a man, hee that ſacrificed a Lamb, at if hee cut off a Dogges neck, hee that offered an Oblation, as if hee offered ſwines blood, he that burneth incenſe, at if hee bleſſed an Idol, Iſa.</hi> 66.3. did hee not undermine their ſtrong holds, and make them naked? for hee ſhews that all they did was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt labour, as the bleſſing of an Idol; or abomination, as ſwines bloud; or dangerous, as cutting off a dogges neck; or deadly, as killing of a man: thus God <hi>polluted them in their own gifts</hi> and doings, and made them deſolate.

This was ingratitude with a witneſſe, that the Lord ſhould bring them into ſuch a land as flowed with milk and honey, and they ſhould beſtow the milk and honey upon Idols, into ſuch a land as was the glory of all lands, and they ſhould defile it, and make it abominable, as it is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.7. <hi>I brought you into a plentiful Countrey, to eat the fruit thereof, and the goodneſs therof, but when ye entered ye defiled my Land, &amp; made mine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage an abomination,</hi> This, this, made their ſin exceeding ſinful, and the Lord to ſet the emphaſis upon it. <hi>There,</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land I eſpied out for them, they ſinned; <hi>there,</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where I fulfilled my promiſe, made to their Fathers and them, they ſinned, <hi>There,</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> out of which I drove mighty Nations for their ſakes, they ſinned. <hi>There,</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land I choſe to dwell in, they ſet up Altars, and diverted my Sacrifices, Offerings, and ſweet ſavours unto them. <hi>There,</hi> where I looked they ſhould have become an holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto mee, they became like the Nations, and worſe than the Nations round about them.</p>
               <p>Sinning after great mercies beſtowed, and where they were beſtowed, makes ſinne ſinful above meaſure.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>When men go out from Gods truths, Ordinances, and waies of worſhip, they are restleſſe, and run from opinion to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from one way to another: they ſaw every high hill, and all the thick trees,</hi> they ran from hill to hill, from tree to tree, and were not long ſatisfied any where, when they had found an hill pleaſed them, ſet up an Altar there, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed a while, they grow to diſlike of that place, and that Altar, then they muſt to another hill, have another Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, which had its time, and then that was left; and to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:118926:49"/> thick trees they go, and there they fall in with the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and waies there in practice, and ſo from Altar to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, from place to place, and not ſatisfied, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.29. and its juſt with God, that thoſe men who go out from him, and off from the waies and forms of worſhip hee hath preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed (depriving him of his legiſlativeneſſe therein) ſhould be given up unto reſtleſſeneſſe of Spirit. This is abundantly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified among the Papiſts, where they runne from Saint to Saint, from Altar to Altar, and from one order of Fryers and Jeſuits to another; yea, this hath been ſignally fulfilled amongſt us, in our daies; wherein many having left and caſt off Gods waies and worſhip, have runne into variety of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and practiſes; they have ſeen every hill, every tree, every Altar, every way; and may it not bee ſaid as of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits in the Goſpel, they have walked in dry places, ſought reſt and found none? Mens waies, opinions, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are dry things, and have no reſt in them. Onely Gods waies and Ordinances have vertue in them, to moiſten, quicken, comfort, and ſatisfy us, <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> what ever the ſickly phanſies of men are, Gods words and waies are good, and they onely do good to the ſonnes of men that walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.29. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> not to thoſe turn aſide to the whimſies, phanſies, and wills of men.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>That may bee offenſive and hateful to God, which men judge to bee grateful and acceptable.

Or if their God were the God of all Nations, yet hee ſhewed more kindneſſe to them, ſerving wood and ſtone, than hee did to the Jewiſh People, who were tyed up by ſtrict Laws; burdened with a multitude of Sacrifices and Ceremonies, now ſpoiled, Captives, held under hard bondage, in danger of being cut off, for <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> revolt and perfidiouſneſſe; whereas the Babylonians and Provinces belonged to them did proſper, were in ſafety and peace; and let the beſt bee made of it, they knew that they muſt abide many years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Babyloniſh yoak, therefore thought it the wiſeſt courſe to become like the Heathens, to conform to their worſhip and manners, whereby they ſhould bee lookt upon as of them, and not of <hi>Abraham;</hi> As men of <hi>Babylon,</hi> not of <hi>Sion;</hi> As <hi>Gentiles</hi> not <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and ſo provide for their ſafety, peace, and Proſperity.</p>
               <q>As the Families of the Countrey.</q>
               <p>They made account to caſt off the worſhip of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which expoſed them to reproach, hatred, and hard ſufferings, and to give up themſelves fully to their Gods, their worſhip, and obſervance of their Rites; they intended to incorporate and become one with the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh race and brood, that ſo they might have a Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh happineſſe, and be free from the ſtroaks of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under whom they ſuffered ſo much.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>How cunningly ſoever Hypocrites do carry their leud and wicked deſignes, yet they are known to God, and hee will diſcover them:</hi> Theſe Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were reſolved to change their Religion, to bee like the Heathen, and colour it over with comming to the Prophet, to inquire how things would proceed with them at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> what Counſel hee would give unto themſelves, they would bee ready to do it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they never intended it. This the Lord ſaw, this hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, and uncaſes theſe diſſembling Hypocrites. <hi>Herod</hi> pretended hee would go and worſhip Chriſt, but his intent was to murder him, <hi>Mathew</hi> 2.8, 13. which God diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>There be riſings, thoughts in mens hearts which are not of God;</hi> what they had in their heads or hearts, God owned not. Many in theſe daies think, every motion they have in their hearts, mindes, whatever riſeth up there, is of God, and his Spirit, and therefore muſt bee obeyed; hence it comes to paſs that darkneſſe is called light, and all vices are practiced under the Notion of vertue; but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, fleſh, old man, Satan, have their operations in the hearts of the wicked alwaies, and too oft in the Godly.<note place="margin">Non omnis impulſus &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſmus, continuo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt.

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Carnal, Politick, men affect Religion as it ſerves their own intereſt.</hi> Theſe Elders conſidering what <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and their Brethren had done at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> revolted from <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar;</hi> they feared hard meaſure now would befall them for their Jewiſh religion, and they reſolved not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture liberty, limbs, or life for that Religion, which had been a bondage, and burdenſome unto them, and now might hazzard all. They would now revolt from God and truth, and bee as the Heathen, who proſpered, were in peace and ſafety. Politicians think it weakneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118926:55"/> for Religion. They can change it at pleaſure, and fall in with that hath moſt pompe and applauſe in the world. Upon this account many have fallen from Proteſtantiſme to Popery, and from Chriſtianity to Turciſme. To ſave their skins they have parted with their Religions. Many men make uſe of Religion as Mariners of the winds, meerly to ſerve their own ends; If Religion once croſſe them, they can caſt it off, and fall in with thoſe waies of worſhip do ſuit their humours and further their deſignes. Like <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> that having been held in by their Parents, beſtow themſelves upon any to obtain their own ends. Theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſaw their Law and worſhip were differing from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the <hi>ſtate</hi> where they were, and ſo expoſed them to many inconveniences and dangers, they would therefore bee of the <hi>ſtate Religion,</hi> outwardly at leaſt, complying with that, ſerving <hi>wood and ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God ſometimes diſappoints the deſignes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, who intend, and reſolve to forſake him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themſelves by ſinful and Idolatrous waies: That which cometh into your mind ſhall not be at all:</hi> You would be as the Heathens, but it ſhall not be. I will not only deny your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, but daſh your deſignes; you ſeek Heathens favour, and ſhall meet with Heavens frowns, and miſs of your aimes; you would be Babylonians, have the protection and bleſſing of Babyloniſh Gods, but my thoughts are croſs to yours, that is in my minde ſhall ſtand, not what is in yours; that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe you hope for in the waies and worſhip of Babylonians you ſhall not finde.

                  <hi>Ruling</hi> imports ſoveraignty, authority, and power over others. Here
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118926:56"/> the <hi>Genus</hi> by a <hi>Senecdoche</hi> is put for the <hi>ſpecies;</hi> the whole work of <hi>ruling,</hi> for puniſhing; and the <hi>ſumme</hi> of the words is this, you think by withdrawing from mee and my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and by <hi>Babylonizing</hi> to ſecure your ſelves, to eſcape dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and all puniſhment; but know aſſuredly, you are my ſubjects, I will not ſuffer you ſo to revolt from mee, I will put forth mine hand, and mine arm, my fury, puniſhing you for your rebellions, and idolatries, ſo, that will you, nill you, me ſhall you acknowledge to be your Lord and Soveraign.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Its a vain thing to think of getting from under the dominion of God, and impoſſible to accompliſh, theſe Elders thought.</hi> To withdraw from under the Laws and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and put themſelves under the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Gods, and <hi>Babylonian</hi> government; but what ſaith God? <hi>I will rule over you,</hi> take what courſe you pleaſe; trans, orm your ſelves into Heatheniſh manners, diſperſe your ſelves into by-corners, villages, Towns, Cities; plant your ſelves in what Province ſoever, of the King of <hi>Babylons,</hi> uſe what policy you can to caſt off my yoak, yet <hi>I will rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you,</hi> for you cannot go from my preſence, nor from my power.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The untoward carriage of Gods people, cauſes him to deal more ſharpely with them.</hi> Rebelliouſneſſe in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth rigidneſſe in him; Their treachery bred ſeverity, <hi>With a mighty hand and fury poured out, will I rule over you.</hi> They thought to run from under him, and he held a ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand over them; They would not willingly obey as Sonnes, hee made them obey as ſervants. When Servants runne from their Maſters, they beſtir them, fetch them back with power, puniſh them ſeverely for their fugitiveneſſe, and hold them harder to it than ever, ſo did the Lord by theſe, and made them know that hee ruled in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as well as in <hi>Sion,</hi> and turned his golden Scepter into an Iron rod, and put a yoak of Iron upon them. This is that the Lord told them in <hi>Moſes</hi> daies, that if they walked contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>God will puniſh thoſe that ſhake off his worſhip to follow falſe waies, with viſible &amp; irreſiſtible puniſhments.</hi> Theſe Elders were upon terms of Apoſtatizing from the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> about to leave his Tents, and to betake themſelves to the Babyloniſh Temples; therefore the Lord ſwears hee will rule over them with a <hi>ſtretched out arm</hi> (hee would viſibly puniſh them) and with <hi>Fury poured out;</hi> they ſhould no more bee able to withſtand it, than a man can a great rain or floud. When ſubjects are upon rebelling, and would fall in with ſome other, this kindles his fury, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him to puniſh them openly and irreſiſtibly, Apoſtacy is a provoking ſinne. Its a reproach to God his truths, and ordinances. Its a violating of all former Promiſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements unto God; its high ingratitude and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; its a great ſcandal unto all the godly, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weak; it incourages, hardens, and juſtifies the wicked, it ruines ſouls, it gratifies Satan, and therefore expoſes men to viſible and unavoidable judgements. You know how God met with <hi>Julian</hi> and other Apoſtates ſince his time; that men ſhould caſt off God is wonder to heaven and earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed O ye heavens at this, my people have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me;</hi> and becauſe they did ſo, Lyons roared upon them, and laid them waſte, v. 15. Egyptians took the crown from their head, v. 16, 17. It bred aſtoniſhment in <hi>Paul,</hi> that the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were ſo ſoon removed from him, that called them into the grace of Chriſt, to another Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. they had Apoſtatizing Spirits, minding another Goſpel, another Chriſt, another way to ſalvation than hee delivered to them; And may it not bee matter of aſtoniſhment to us, that many are ſo ſhaken, that they have caſt off our God, our Chriſt, our Goſpel, our Ordinances, and have found out another Goſpel, another Chriſt, and another way to ſalvation than ever; But it is to bee feared ſome <hi>remarkable</hi> and <hi>unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> judgements are near unto them. God hath no <hi>pleaſure</hi> in thoſe draw back, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. They have caſt off the thing that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118926:57"/> is <hi>good,</hi> the enemy ſhall <hi>purſue</hi> them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.3. Theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have <hi>purpoſed</hi> to become like the Heathen, and God ſware preſently to puniſh them openly and irreſiſtibly; what will hee then do to thoſe have actually withdrawn from him, and his waies, ſurely his wrath will <hi>ſmoak</hi> againſt them. Let us take heed in theſe declining times of falling away from God and his waies; Beware of <hi>Carnal policy,</hi> which was the thing here put theſe Elders upon it. Beware of <hi>Carnal Relations</hi> and unmortified luſts, which made <hi>Spira</hi> and <hi>Spalato</hi> revolt ſo foulely; beware of <hi>Promotion and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> which made <hi>H.</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> to turn Papiſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of falſe <hi>Teachers,</hi> corrupt opinions, which have made many among us to go ſo far from God and his waies. Keep innocency, count all the glory and greatneſſe of the world as nothing: prize truth and the waies of God highly, cleave fully to Chriſt, live by faith, prove all things, and hold faſt what is good, ſo ſhall there never bee an evil heart in you of unbeleef, to depart from the living God.</p>

               <p>If it was free Grace brought the Jews out of <hi>Babylon</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> what is it but freeneſſe, fulneſſe, and riches of grace to bring men out of the world into the heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> Predeſtination, Calling, Juſtification, and Glorification, are acts of meer grace, and favour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. All the Sonnes of men injoy here, or expect hereafter, is from the bounty, favour, and mercy of God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 103.8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. to attribute ought to our own wills or indeavours, is to derogate from God, and darken the glory of his name, and free grace.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>God doth therefore deal gratiouſly with ſinners, that they may know him experimentally; Yee ſhal know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my Name ſake, &amp;c.</hi> God works, and ſo works, that hee makes the hearts of men affected with his works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſay, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.8. <hi>Among the Gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord, neither are there any works like unto thy works,</hi> none ſo full of Glory, ſo full of grace and mercy, none ſo influential and operative upon the heart. Its Gods ſcope and aim in doing good ſo freely, and fully as hee doth, to make himſelf known to the hearts
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:118926:74"/> of his People, that ſo they may bee knit to him, provoke them to admire him, and live more fully to him.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118926:93"/> let us abhorre, but uſe thoſe means God approves of, and hath appointed for our reſolution in our doubts and ſtraits. Inſtead of making bright the Arrows, let us purge and make bright our conſciences, and they will tell us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; inſtead of conſulting Teraphims, Stocks, and Stones, let us conſult with God and his Servants; inſtead of looking into the Liver of Beaſts, let us look into the book of God, there wee ſhall finde light to diſpel our darkneſſe, and to direct our waies; <hi>David</hi> made Gods Teſtimonies his delight and Counſellors, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.24.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>God over-rules the wicked acts of Men, and makes them ſubſervient to his will and ends; Nebuchadnezzar</hi> uſes Divinations which God had forbidden, and the Divination might have been at his left hand for <hi>Rabbath</hi> or <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which is the ſame, but God had a purpoſe to bring him to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to caſt up a mount, to build a Fort there, to ſet battering Rammes againſt the Gates thereof, and therefore ſecretly by his Providence, hee ordered the Divination, that it ſhould bee at his right hand for <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> whatever the Lot is, whereſoever it bee caſt, the whole diſpoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33.

Divinations of Heathens, promote the work of Heaven. This is a myſtery, but full of truth and admiration, that God makes the worſt Tools and Inſtruments, all wicked men, and their waies, to ſerve his Providence, further his ends, and advance his glory; the Devil did it in tempting <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> in betraying Chriſt.</p>

               <q>To them that have ſworn Oathes.</q>
               <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Swearing Oathes to them. Rabbi David</hi> expreſſes the words thus, <hi>Propter juramenta juramentorum ipſis, for the Oathes upon Oathes made to them.</hi> The falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had by many Oathes confirmed them, that the City ſhould never bee taken, whereupon they were ſecure as men that keep Sabbaths, who are at reſt. The Septuagint turn thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which ſignifies ſeven, and thereupon a Sabbath, and alſo to ſwear. In this ſenſe wee take it, and the Jews might bee ſecure upon the Oathes of their falſe Prophets, but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they made ſuch oathes is doubtful, rather becauſe of the Oathes beween them and the Egyptians, for having violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Oath and Covenant with the Babylonians, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred league with the Egyptians, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.15. who promiſed them help, horſes, and much people, and that againſt the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, if ever they ſhould come.</p>
               <q>But he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</q>

                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:118926:94"/> this divination falling on the right hand of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and leading him to <hi>Jeruſalem, will bring to minde the iniquity,</hi> that is, the perfidiouſneſſe of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and the reſt in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oath that they may bee taken. If wee read it, <hi>he,</hi> that is <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> hee will remember the iniquity of <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah, Hehittapheſh, ut Capiatur,</hi> that he and thoſe with him might be taken.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That the meſſages and paſſages of the meſſengers of God, are matter of ſcorn to prophane and wicked men; It will bee unto them as a falſe divination in their ſight:</hi> when the Prophet pourtrayed out the way the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould come, the things he ſhould do, the ſiedge hee ſhould make about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the effects thereof, all theſe were reputed by them, lying things, falſe divinations. What hee told them in the latter end of the twentieth Chapter, they cryed out of as Parables, dark, and obſcure things, which they underſtood not, and here they account his typical threatnings, as falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and lyes. When the falſe Prophets fed them with ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing viſions and divinations, they were honoured and beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1 <hi>King</hi> 22.11, 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.6. but when the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets told them the minde of the Lord, they were reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, as <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt falſely, <hi>chap.</hi> 43.2. they were ſmitten and impriſoned as <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. their lives were ſought, Jer. 38.4. yea, they were put to death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.20, 21.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That thoſe who break, and make oathes, for their own ends, making no conſcience thereof, God leaves them to injudiciouſneſſe of ſpirit, and to ſtumble at his word and threats: it ſhall bee unto them as a falſe divination in their ſight, to them that ſwear oathes:</hi> They ſware to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated what they had ſworn, for their own advantages, and then ſought for their ſecurity to the Egyptians; but what was the fruit hereof? they were given over to injudicious mindes, and impenitent hearts, ſo that they diſcerned not Gods proceedings towards them, nor the Prophets language to them: perfidious and injuſt dealings, do ſo blind and harden, that the word and waies of God become ſnares and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks unto them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The iniquities of Princes and People, do not alwaies

Zedekiah,</hi> his Nobles, and People ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in breaking with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and falling in with Egyptians, they thought that time would bring a veil over thoſe paſſages, that they ſhould bee buried in the dark, lye ſtill and never ſee light more: but thoſe iniquities were brought to minde, when the Divination fell on the right hand, and drew <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> hee called to minde what cauſe hee had to invade their land, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiedge that City; hee remembred how perfidiouſly they had dealt with him, and thereupon rouſes up himſelf, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſet upon them with all their might.

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That Princes oft times are far from Piety, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: And thou prophane wicked Prince of Iſrael.</hi> Of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world, the Princes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had cauſe to bee holy and juſt, they were ſeated where the worſhip of the true God was, they had the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and were commanded to read it continually, and not to depart from it, to the right hand or to the left, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. they had the Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, the Prieſts, and Prophets to counſell and adviſe them; yet Princes of Iſrael were prophane, they minded not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the worſhip of God, they deſpiſed Prieſts and Prophets, they were wicked, they perſecuted good men, and were perfidious to other Princes, both <hi>Johoiakim</hi> and <hi>Zedekiah</hi> were ſo to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 24.1. and 20. verſes. The Prophaneneſſe and perfidiouſneſſe of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces hath been great. Among all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> there was none good, they followed <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> who were prophane and wicked. Few among the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> were found good. How prophane was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him? Exod.</hi> 5.2. how prophane was <hi>Belſhazzar;</hi> when hee quaffed in the bowls of the Temple? <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. how prophane was <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that thruſt aſide the Lords Altar, and ſet up the Damaſcene Altar? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16. how prophane was <hi>Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim,</hi> that cut the roll of <hi>Jeremy</hi> in peeces, and caſt it into the fire? <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.23. how prophane was <hi>Herod,</hi> who mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt? ſet him at nought, and arraied him in a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner? <hi>Luke</hi> 23.11. They were Kings that gave their power and ſtrength to the beaſt, and made war with the Lambe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. you may read the horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe of <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the 1 <hi>Macch.</hi> 1.46, 47, 48 49, 50, 51, 52. hee ſent letters to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to forbid what God had appointed; hee commanded them to offer Swines fleſh, and unclean beaſts; that they ſhould defile their ſouls, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute themſelves with uncleanneſſe; that they might forget the Law, and change all the Ordinances; and if they would not do ſo, they ſhould dye for it. Kings and Rulers have been the greateſt enemies to the waies of God and Chriſt, they above others have ſet themſelves againſt them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2.2, 3. Hence they are counſelled to be wiſe and to kiſs the Son, ver. 10.12.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That the Prophets and Miniſters of God, are not to fear the faces or frowns of the greateſt, but to reprove them ſharpely, being evidently guilty:</hi> Thus dealt <hi>Ezekiel</hi> with <hi>Zedekiah, Thou prophane and wicked Prince of Iſrael:</hi> though hee were great, yet hee ſpares him not, but brands him with his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and ſets it upon record for after generations. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> did the like by <hi>Herod,</hi> when hee was upon taking his Brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, hee told him it was unlawful, and would bee an inceſtuous match, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.18. hee was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his miniſtery, and would not flatter <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf. Neither Magiſtrates nor Miniſters ſhould fear or flatter the greateſt, becauſe they are Agents for, and Embaſſadors of the great God of heaven, in compariſon of whom the greateſt on earth are as Pot-ſheards.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>That as Princes have their times for ſinning, ſo there bee times for their ſuffering: Zedekiahs</hi> day was come, when iniquity ſhould have an end, hee had his times to ſhew his prophaneneſſe and wickedneſſe, and God had his time to reckon with him for the ſame. Princes may abound in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, go long unpuniſhed, but there is a day, a time, comming, wherein they ſhall ſmart for their lewdneſſe. <hi>David</hi> tells you, the day of wicked men is comming, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.13. that is, the time and ſeaſon ſet for their deſtruction; which <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth thus, 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.3. their judgement lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greth not, and their damnation ſlumbereth not, its making towards them, and comming on ſwiftly, and will bee bad to them when it comes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.27. <hi>wo unto them, for their day is come, the time of their viſitation.</hi> That day is a viſiting day; God is the viſitor, and hee will ſo viſit them as ſhall breed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, <hi>Job</hi> 18.20. <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaking of the calamities ſhould befall the wicked in his day, ſaith, <hi>They that come after him, ſhall be aſtoniſhed at his day, as they that went before were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted.</hi> The day of Gods viſiting thoſe are eminently wicked, as <hi>Princes</hi> and great ones, is ſo dreadful, as that it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights the living which behold it, and aſtoniſheth the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come after it.

Of theſe words were ſpoken before, ch. 20.4.</p>
               <p>If wee read them as <hi>Montanus, Aecolampadius,</hi> and ſome others do, thus, <hi>wilt thou not judge, wilt thou not judge the bloudy City?</hi> that is, wilt thou not reprove, and tell it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of its iniquities? what, wilt thou faint, give over, and

               <q>The bloudy City.</q>
               <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>The City of blouds. Jeruſalem</hi> which is ſo called, becauſe ſhee had ſhed much innocent bloud, and was become very cruel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.4. <hi>yee have filled this place with the bloud of Innocents,</hi> and 2 <hi>King</hi> 21.16. <hi>Manaſſes</hi> ſhed ſo much innocent <hi>bloud</hi> therein, that hee filled <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> from one end to the other therewith; yea, ſo <hi>bloudy</hi> was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that ſhe filled the land with <hi>bloud</hi> and <hi>bloudy</hi> crimes, <hi>Ezek</hi> 7.23. ch. 9.9. and how bloudy this City was, appears in the 3, 4, 6, 9. verſ. of this chapter.</p>
               <p>Obſ. <hi>The ſinnes of a City and Nation may bee ſuch, that God will not have his Prophets to plead or intercede for them, but to cry out againſt them. Sonne of Man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloudy City:</hi> I know thou art very charitable, and ready to ſpeak for them, but the City is ſo bloudy, and full of Abominations, that I will not have thee to appear or move for them, but thou muſt ſet their ſinnes in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and thunder out my judgements againſt them. When there is a fulneſſe of ſinne, ſo that its univerſal in all ſorts, ſinners are grown impudent and obſtinate, then the Lord ſtops his ears, and the mouths of his Prophets, hee will have no <hi>pleading</hi> for ſuch a people. This was the caſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſinne had ſpread it ſelf through all rankes of people, as you ſhall finde in this Chapter, and her Children were impudent and hard hearted, <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> 3. <hi>verſe</hi> 7.</p>

               <p>In the former words was a violation of the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in theſe is a <hi>violation</hi> of the firſt.

Jeruſalem</hi> in ſhedding of bloud, had done wickedly, ſhamefully, and ſo became guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a witneſſe, exceeding guilty, ſhee cut not off the wicked, to take guilt off from her ſelf and the land, but ſhe murdered the innocent, and multiplied guilt thereby upon her ſelf, and the Nation.</p>
               <q>Thou haſt defiled thy ſelf in the Idols which thou haſt made.</q>
               <p>Thou haſt made Idols, thinking thereby to pleaſe God,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:118926:113"/> and pacify his anger, but they have defiled thee, made thee hateful unto God, and increaſed his wrath much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee.

               <q>Thou haſt cauſed thy daies to draw neer, and art come even unto thy years.</q>
               <p>Thou haſt by thy tranſgreſſions, broken the thread of my patience, and haſtened judgement to come upon thee, I gave thee time to repent, and prevent my wrath from breaking out aginſt thee, but thou having abuſed my patience, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent thy time, art become worſe, and now vengeance is at thy gates, and ready to enter. The time is come for the ſword to viſit thee, and that thou ſhalt go into Captivity.</p>
               <q>Therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the Heathen.</q>
               <p>

How blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Popiſh Idolaters are, the Pariſian maſſachre heretofore, and the Iriſh of late do witneſſe; when men once make gods, and form waies of worſhip to themſelves, they are zealous for them; will laviſh out gold to maintain them, and be laviſh of their bloud that oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Great ſinnes do accelerate the judgements of God, they put wings unto them, and cauſe them to make haſte.

There is not a land, City, Town, or family in the whole earth, but the eye of the Lord is upon it, and hee ſees what it is, whether it bee defiled, and how greatly defiled, hee knew what <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> were, before hee ſent fire from heaven upon them.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>When Lands have had means of cleanſing, and are not cleanſed, they are matter of indignation and exprobration unto God. Judaea</hi> had the Prophets, ſometimes good magiſtrates, it had great mercies, great judgements, ſolemn faſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Joel</hi> 1.14. but was ſtill uncleanſed, therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>Thou art the land that is not cleanſed.</hi> The word <hi>Thou</hi> notes <hi>Gods indignation</hi> at them, and his <hi>Exprobration</hi> of them. When a ground is full of thornes, bryars, nettles, vermine, and wilde beaſts, and the Husband mans ſervants cannot with all their art and pains rid the ground of them, that ground exaſperates the Husband-man, and makes him ſay, this is the ground will not bee cleanſed, that brings forth nothing is good, ſo was it here with <hi>Judea, Iſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>what could have been done more to my vineyard? that I have not done in it? wherefore when I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for grapes, brought it forth wilde grapes?</hi> it retained its ſowreneſſe, notwithſtanding all done, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſſe any more:</hi> Seeing I have uſed means to purge thee, and thou wilt not bee purged, ſeeing thou art obſtinate, and there is lewdneſſe in thy filthineſſe, there ſhall no more purgative means bee afforded thee, <hi>but I will bring my fury, and cauſe it to reſt upon thee.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The Lord hath his day and time to judge and puniſh lands uncleanſed, people unreformed, in the day of indignation:</hi> Though the Lord bear <hi>long</hi> with a ſinful nation, yet hee will not bear <hi>alwaies,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> comes at laſt, that his hot anger breaks out and damnifies. <hi>This day of indignation,</hi> was when the Lord called the Babyloniſh army, to the walls of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jer.</hi> 4.6, 7, 9, 13. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 52.4. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.14, 15.

               <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Goder gader, hedging an hedge.</hi> Vulg. <hi>Qui interponeret ſepem.</hi> The words are metaphorical; and the metaphor is taken from vineyards, gardens, and places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, which uſe to have fences and hedges about them, to preſerve them from every thing might harm them, both men and beaſts.

Now when they tranſgreſſed the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the <hi>hedge</hi> was broken, and gaps were made.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew for <hi>Gaps</hi> is <hi>bapperetz, in the breach,</hi> from <hi>paratz,</hi> to <hi>divide</hi> and <hi>break through.</hi> They had now broke through the <hi>Hedge,</hi> and made many <hi>Gaps,</hi> which appears thus.</p>

               <p n="2">2 For the <hi>Worſhip, That was greatly corrupted.</hi> The Sanctuary was defiled with deteſtable things, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.11. they had brought Images and Idols near to the Temple, and into the Temple, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8. they had high places and Altars in every ſtreet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. they burnt incenſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods, and worſhipped the works of their own hands,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118926:146"/> 
                  <hi>Jerem.</hi> 1.16. The Statutes of <hi>Omry</hi> were kept, and the works of the houſe of <hi>Ahab, Micah</hi> 6.16. and the fear or worſhip of God was taught by the precepts of men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The <hi>Laws were wreſted and perverted,</hi> ſo that there was no juſtice, <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.9. <hi>They abhor judgement, and pervert all equity;</hi> all that was right, equal, juſt, they oppreſſed or ſuppreſſed, and would not let it take place; ſo that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> judgement was turned away backward, and juſtice ſtood farre off; they thruſt them out of doors, out of their gates and Cities, and when they preſſed hard to come in, there was no admiſſion, the doors and gates were lockt and bolted upon them, equity could not enter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.14. only oppreſſion was let in, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.7.</p>
               <p n="4">4 For <hi>The men,</hi> who ſhould have been as ſtrong ſtakes to keep up the hedge, <hi>they were rotten.</hi> The <hi>Prophets</hi> were Lyons, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.14. the <hi>Prieſts</hi> corrupters and wicked, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.13. the <hi>Princes</hi> were rebellious, and companions of Theeves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. and all of them brake Covenant with God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.59. ſo that its evident the <hi>hedge</hi> was brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and <hi>gaps</hi> made.</p>
               <q>To make up the hedge, and ſtand in the gap.</q>
               <p>What that is, falls in now to be conſidered, and it lies in theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>In publike oppoſing thoſe corruptions were crept in, and practiſed amongſt them.</hi> When of old the Jews had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the <hi>hedge,</hi> by making a Calfe, <hi>Moſes</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for God againſt this wickedneſſe, hee ſeized upon the Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. burnt it, ground it to powder, made the people drink it, ſharpely reproved <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>ſtood in the gate of the Campe, ſaying, who is on the Lords ſide? let him come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee,</hi> and when the Sonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> came to him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned them to ſlay the Idolaters, and this was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of making up the breach; ſo when <hi>Joſiah</hi> beganne to purge <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the high places, the groves, images, and Altars, that were therein, then was the hedge making up which they had broken down, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.3, 4.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118926:146"/> In <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> daies, when the hedge was new made about them, there were ſome began to tread down the <hi>hedge,</hi> and make a <hi>gap</hi> therein by doing unlawful things on the Lords day, whereupon the zeal of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was kindled; ſo that hee contended with the Nobles of <hi>Judah,</hi> who countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, and did violence to the Sabbath themſelves: <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what evil thing is this that yee do, and prophane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? Neh.</hi> 13.15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>In mourning for ſuch breaches, and deprecating the wrath and judgements due for the ſame.</hi> When the Calfe was made and the people worſhipped it, now the <hi>hedge</hi> was down, Gods <hi>wrath</hi> ready to break in upon them, and to conſume them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.10. but <hi>Moſes</hi> being affected much with what they had done, and with what God was about to do, he falls to <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>interceding</hi> for the People, <hi>Lord why doth thy wrath wax hot againſt thy people? &amp;c. wherefore ſhould the Egyptians ſpeak and ſay, for miſchief did hee bring them out to ſlay them in the mountains? &amp;c. turn from thy feirce wrath and repent of this evil againſt thy People,</hi> and he did ſo, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. now this act of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtanding in the <hi>breach,</hi> and <hi>mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> up the <hi>hedge, Pſalm</hi> 106.23. it kept out the fury of the Lord from breaking in upon them. The <hi>interceſſion</hi> of Gods ſervants is a <hi>ſtrong hedge,</hi> and wall to prevent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore when the Lord was reſolved upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Jews, he forbade <hi>Jeremy</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for them, <hi>ch.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interceſſion to me, for I will not hear thee. Interceſſion</hi> or <hi>deprecation</hi> is an obſtructing of God in his way; The Vulgar hath it, <hi>Ne obſiſtas mihi, do not thou ſtop or oppoſe mee.</hi> When an Army is marching to a Town to deſtroy it, if there bee a <hi>ſtrong wall</hi> in their way, that puts them to a ſtand, and oft cauſeth them to give over their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. So <hi>Prayers</hi> againſt judgements, when God is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out to deſtroy a people, puts him to a ſtand, and oft cauſes him to retreat into heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>In putting things into their primitive condition.</hi> When the buſhes trod down, and ſtakes pull'd out, are put into their places again, or new in their rooms, then is the <hi>hedge</hi> made up: When <hi>Joſiah</hi> cauſed the houſe of the Lord to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118926:147"/> the Covenant with God to bee renewed, the Law to bee read, and the Paſſeover to bee kept according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thereof, and all things were brought to their <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive condition,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. &amp; 35. chapt. then was the <hi>hedge</hi> made up, then was there <hi>a man ſtood in the gap</hi> before the Lord. So when <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> brought back the people, from falſe doctrin, and falſe worſhip, to the Lord God of their fathers, that was to the true Religion and worſhip, and ſet Judges in all the fenced Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſet Levites, Prieſts, and the chief of the Fathers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and inſtructed them to do all things faithfully, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, and for the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.4. &amp;c. when hee brought things to the pattern in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s daies, then was the <hi>hedge</hi> made up, then God was with them, and protected them againſt thoſe wilde beaſts, the Ammonites, Moabites, and theſe of Mount <hi>Seir, ch.</hi> 20.</p>
               <q>For the Land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it.</q>
               <p>By <hi>Land,</hi> is meant <hi>the people of the land,</hi> the inhabitants, and their habitations, which were all ſhortly after laid waſte by the Chaldaean Army. The Septuagint renders theſe words,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>God by degrees left the Temple, the City, the land, and none of them intreated him to ſtay, and when he was gone, deſtruction came upon them.</p>
               <q>But I found none.</q>
               <p>Was there not <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> who interceded with God for this people? were there not many that mourned for the abominations that were amongſt them? <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.1. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9 4.8.</p>
               <p>Its true, <hi>Jeremy</hi> did appear for God, hee oppoſed the falſe Prophets, cryed out of their falſe and corrupt waies of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the perverting of juſtice, the iniquities of Prieſts, Princes, and People, but they would not hearken to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.16. they deviſed deviſes againſt him, and ſlandered

               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hee was in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Lord looked for a man amongſt them in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo the Lord tells <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> here, <hi>I looked for a man among them,</hi> not among you.</p>
               <p>For the ſighers and mourners that were in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they did it in ſecret, and durſt not openly bee ſeen, they had not ſpirits to contradict the wicked Prophets, Prieſts, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or if they had, yet they ſaw there was no good to bee done, the times were exceeding and deſperately wicked; a man was made <hi>an offender for a word,</hi> and a <hi>ſnare was laid for him</hi> reproved in the gate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.21. if any appeared openly to ſpeak againſt them and their waies, they were made a <hi>prey.</hi> It was an <hi>evil time,</hi> and the time for the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>keep ſilence, Amos</hi> 5.12, 13. So then there was none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Prophets, the Prieſts, the Princes, or people, whom hee mentioned in the verſes before, that minded or made up the <hi>hedge,</hi> or ſtood in the <hi>gap.</hi>

Religion was a foundation unto them, but they had ſo corrupted the doctrine and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, made ſuch breaches therein, that God was departing far from the Sanctuary, and ſo from them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.6.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>When breaches and gaps are made by ſinne, the Lord hath a purpoſe to let in his judgements thereby, and to deſtroy for the ſame;</hi> They had trode down the hedge, and God had thoughts to deſtroy the land, to bring in a flood of wrath, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.8.13.21, you may ſee how upon their making <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> upon the worſhip, Statutes, and Sabbaths of the Lord, hee reſolved to pour out his <hi>fury</hi> upon them, and to <hi>conſume</hi> them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. you have the <hi>gaps</hi> their ſinnes made, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. the reſolution of God thereupon, <hi>Ah I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge mee of mine Enemies.</hi> They had made <hi>breaches</hi> upon his Law, and hee would make <hi>breaches</hi> upon them.

When lately the <hi>hedge</hi> was trodden down here in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>gaps</hi> made in it, did not the Lord let in wilde beaſts to <hi>devour?</hi> were not our Princes roaring Lyons, our Judges evening wolves? did not the Prelates and Prieſts raven the <hi>prey?</hi> Devour ſoules, take the treaſure and pretious things? though now the wilde beaſts bee deſtroyed, or driven to their denns, yet every <hi>gap</hi> is not ſtopt, nor the <hi>hedge</hi> fully made up.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>When the hedge is down, gaps are made, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ready to come in upon a people; the Lord looks that one or other ſhould appear, put forth himſelf to prevent thoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>Seeing they were guilty of ſuch ſinnes as are mentioned in the chapter, and ſo univerſally corrupt, the Lord in this laſt verſe, <hi>denounces judgements</hi> againſt them.

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>When a people is univerſally corrupt, the hedges of religion and juſtice trod down, and none appears to make up thoſe hedges, God will certainly viſit that people with his judgements.</hi> Prophets, Prieſts, Princes, and people, were degenerated and greatly corrupted, all <hi>hedges</hi> down, God looked for ſome or other to appear againſt the corruptions were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and becauſe there <hi>was none,</hi> therefore he would pour out his indignation upon them and conſume them with the fire of his wrath, and they found it ſo ſhortly after, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.4. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.11. they and their foundations were devoured.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That God in his ſevereſt judgements is moſt juſt, I have or will recompenſe their own way upon their head;</hi> God did not puniſh them for others waies, but for their own; it was their own evil doings, brought his judgements upon them, he did them no wrong, when ſword, famine, plague, fire, conſumed them, what ever dreadful judgements have fallen out in our daies, in this or other nations, let us juſtify the Lord, hee hath recompenſed mens own waies, upon their heads; he is righteous in all his works, and holy in all his waies.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The Lord takes notice where and when thoſe are in relation to him do ſinne: They committed whoredomes in Egypt and in their youth,</hi> they ſinned amidſt the grand and bitter enemies of God, among Egyptians, and then when they were but growing up to bee a people. They ſhould have conſidered what enemies the Egyptians were to their God, and to his worſhip, how odious their waies and worſhip were to him, that ſo they might have kept at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, they ſhould have walked circumſpectly, that ſo they might have kept his name from being polluted, and likewiſe they being in their youth under bondage, ſhould have minded Gods kindneſſe in preſerving them, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to proſper, but they did not, they ſinned in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and in their youth, two great aggravations of their ſinne.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118926:152"/> When God is beginning to ſhew kindneſſe to a people in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and raiſing them up to ſome height and greatneſſe, and then for them to turn aſide to lewdneſſe, to ſuperſtitious, idolatrous and heatheniſh practices, this God obſerves in a ſpecial manner, and it provokes him greatly.

               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God makes places and perſons remarkeable, by the judgements he executeth upon them. Aholah</hi> was made famous among women, by thoſe judgements hee brought upon her: <hi>Aholah</hi> was <hi>Samaria,</hi> which <hi>Shalmanezer</hi> beſiedged three years, and then took it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.5, 6. and after burnt it, as <hi>Lavater</hi> obſerves.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Neglect and contempt of God, and his word, cauſes him to execute judgement: becauſe thou haſt forgotten me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and caſt mee behind thy back, therefore bear thou alſo thy lewdneſſe, and thy whoredomes:</hi> That is, bear the puniſhment of thy lewdneſſe and whoredomes, thou haſt made mee bear thy ſinnes, and thou ſhalt bear my puniſhments. As the fear of God is the beginning of wiſdome, ſo the forgetting of God is the beginning of Folly, and all evill; then God is out of ſight, behind the back, and what will not men do, when no awe of God or his word is upon them? Then like <hi>Aholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi>

               <p>God had done much for <hi>Aholibah,</hi> dealt by her like a loving husband, but ſhee ſleighted him, went out a whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, did thoſe things which greatly diſhonoured him, and ſo provoked him to minde her, that forgate him; for hee fell upon her with his judgements, and deſtroyed her; and ſo will the Lord do by all that forget him, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9.17. <hi>the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell and all the Nations that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God:</hi> whatever ſins the Nations commit, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in their <hi>forgetting</hi> God, that's the <hi>root</hi> of all evil; and becauſe they did forget God, they ſhould be <hi>turned into Hell,</hi> and bear the burden of their ſins there for ever.</p>

               <p>Of <hi>Defiling the Sanctuary,</hi> ſee chap. 5.11. where theſe words, <hi>becauſe thou haſt defiled my Sanctuary,</hi> were handled: and of <hi>prophaning the Sabbaths,</hi> was ſpoken chap. 20.13.16. and chap. 22.8.</p>
               <p>One thing here is to bee conſidered, <hi>viz. the time</hi> when they did <hi>defile</hi> the Sanctuary, and <hi>prophane</hi> the Sabbaths, its ſaid <hi>in the ſame day,</hi> what <hi>day</hi> that was, the next verſe tells us more fully.</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>39</hi>
                  </bibl> When they had ſlain their children to their idols, then they came the ſame day into my Sanctuary to prophane it.</q>
               <p>It was unnatural and barbarous for them to ſlay their children, impious to offer them to idols, to Devils, and to do thoſe things upon the Sabbath days, wherein they were to reſt from ordinary works, how extreamly wicked, and abominable was it, and then after ſuch evils to come into the Temple, and appear before God, as if they had done no wickedneſs, but well; what height of iniquity was here? It was as if a woman playing the whore with another, ſhould immediately come from him to her Husband, pretending conjugal love. The bloud of their children was yet hot upon their hands, and freſh upon their skirts, and in that pickle they came into the Temple to have communion with God in his worſhip.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:118926:164"/>Loe, Thus have they done in the midſt of mine houſe.</q>
               <p>They have not onely ſet up Idols in Hills and Groves, offered their children to <hi>Molech</hi> in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> but they have ſet up Idols in the Temple, and have ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their children to them there. So I find ſome interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to underſtand theſe words, <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſaith, <hi>Etiam in ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Templo filios ſuos ſacrificaverunt,</hi> and hee grounds it upon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.10, 11. which places prove there were I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols in the Temple, that they ſacrificed unto them, but not that they ſacrificed their children <hi>there;</hi> but rather came with the guilt of their childrens bloud upon them into the Temple, and ſo polluted it, and the worſhip of it.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That wicked ones make little or no conſcience of horrible ſinnes, or holy duties; they do paſs from the one to the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</hi> When <hi>Aholah</hi> and <hi>Aholibah</hi> had ſlain their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their idols, the ſame day they came into the ſanctuary and joyned in the duties of the place and day; from ſhedding of bloud and ſacrificing to Idols, they ſtep into the Temple, and worſhip of God. Had not their <hi>Conſciences</hi> been ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would have accuſed them, and told them, they were unclean, not fit to meddle with holy things, that they might look for vengeance every hour, who had done ſuch things, and that if they came before the Lord, hee would bee a conſuming fire unto them, but they go boldly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently into his preſence, not being troubled for what they had done, nor conſidering how they polluted holy things: So in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.9, 10. they did ſteal, murther, commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ſwear falſely, burn incenſe to <hi>Baal,</hi> walk after other gods, and then come preſently and ſtand before him in his houſe, and ſay, wee are delivered, they paſſed from wicked practiſes unto holy duties, making no <hi>conſcience</hi> of the one, or the other.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The Lord takes notice how men draw near to him on his daies, in the duties of his worſhip:</hi> when they ſlew their Children to their Idols, then they came to my Sanctuary the ſame day; they defiled themſelves with bloud and idolatry, on my Sabbaths, and in thoſe defilements they came to
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:118926:164"/> worſhip mee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.10. God obſerved them there, how they came in their ſinnes, and ſtood before him, they were noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly wicked, and thruſt into the Temple worſhip, and into the preſence of God, as if they had been innocent, and as acceptable to God as any. Men may deceive others and themſelves: but they cannot deceive the Lord, hee ſees their ſpirits, knows them <hi>intus &amp; in cute,</hi> whether they come before him with bloudy, idolatrous, unclean, prophane, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, proud, froward, and malicious hearts, or no; whether they come unprepared in the guilt of former or preſent ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Prophaning of holy things is wronging of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes greatly, and cauſes him to ſet an emphaſis thereon:</hi> When they had ſinned, and ſo came into the Sanctuary, and prophaned that and the Sabbath, ſaith God, <hi>This they have done unto mee. Loe, Thus have they done in the midſt of mine houſe.</hi> God takes the wrong done to his houſe, worſhip, and day, as done unto himſelf, for hee dwelt in the Temple, inſtituted the worſhip, and day, had ſtamped holineſſe upon them, and therefore the defiling and <hi>prophaning</hi> of them, hee counted the <hi>defiling</hi> and <hi>prophaning</hi> of his name, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and it did ſo <hi>ſorely offend him,</hi> that he ſets a <hi>double mark</hi> or brand thereupon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This have they done to mee, Thus have they done in my houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three waies eſpecially are holy things <hi>defiled, prophaned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>When men come in their ſinnes,</hi> without purging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and preparing for them, <hi>James</hi> 4.8. if men draw near to God without cleanſing their hands, and purifying their hearts, God will not draw near them, hee will not touch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean things, they will <hi>defile</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>When we mingle ought of ours therewith:</hi> Additions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things, are pollutions of divine things: when they brought ought into the Temple which God appointed not, that was a <hi>defiling</hi> that, and the worſhip thereof: when <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> put ſtrange fire into the cenſers, they <hi>defiled</hi> them, the worſhip, and provoked God, to their deſtruction, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. and when they ſet their threſhold with Gods threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they <hi>defiled</hi> his name and worſhip, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:118926:165"/>3 <hi>When holy things are handled irreverently.</hi> The <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemites</hi> in a rude manner peeped into the Ark, and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned</hi> it, which cauſed the Lord to ſmite them with ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain death, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. Hence it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives Counſel, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1. that men ſhould keep their feet, when they go to the houſe of God; why then? becauſe they are to bee converſant in holy things; and if they look not well to their affections, they will play the fools; and <hi>prophane</hi> thoſe holy things, and procure a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing.</p>

               <p>Here was the <hi>Occaſion</hi> or <hi>cauſe</hi> of his writing down the <hi>day,</hi> and ſo propheſying upon it; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was that <hi>day</hi> ſitting down before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as you may clearly ſee 1 <hi>King.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.1. <hi>ch.</hi> 52.4. when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was upon a warlike expedition, hee knew not whether he ſhould go to <hi>Rabbath</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> chap. 21.21. but hee was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a divine hand, to lay ſiedge to <hi>Jeruſalem, the tenth day of the tenth month, in the ninth year,</hi> which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could

               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>The Lord takes notice of what men do, and can make known the ſame to whom hee pleaſes at what diſtance ſoever.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>There bee ſome things and times the Lord would have his take ſpecial notice of, and keep the Chronology thereof: Ezekiel</hi> muſt write the <hi>year,</hi> the <hi>month,</hi> and <hi>day,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> beſiedging: <hi>In the ninth year, the tenth month, the tenth day, the King of Babylon ſet himſelf againſt Jeruſalem;</hi> that was a ſad buſineſſe, and a ſad time.

               <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Rattach retacheah,</hi> which <hi>Montanus</hi> renders, <hi>Fas ebullire ebullitiones ejus, make its boilings to boile, boile it throughly,</hi> There bee old tough <hi>peices</hi> in the <hi>Pot,</hi> which will not eaſily or ſuddainly bee <hi>boiled,</hi> they will require a hot and continued fire, therefore <hi>Buxtorf.</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the words, <hi>fac ut vehementer ferveant, ſee that the boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be very hot.</hi> The Chaldaean Army were not the <hi>bones,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> under this metaphorical <hi>Pot,</hi> but the <hi>bellows</hi> rather to blow up and increaſe the <hi>fire.</hi>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>The ſinfulneſſe of men hath occaſioned God to give out much Scripture. Speak a parable to the rebellious.</hi> God took <hi>occaſion</hi> from their <hi>rebelliouſneſſe,</hi> to <hi>give forth</hi> this <hi>Parable</hi> and many others. Much of <hi>Jeremy</hi> and our Prophet was <hi>occaſioned</hi> to ſee the world, by the wickedneſſe of the Jews. Sinne accidentally <hi>occaſions</hi> good, Sinne made way for Chriſt, and as for him, ſo for much, if not the greateſt part of the holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Teaching by Parables is warrantable.</hi> God ſends and commands the Prophet to utter a <hi>Parable. Iſaiah, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, Zachary,</hi> were not without <hi>Parables.</hi> Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in them. The <hi>Parables</hi> they uſed were taken from ordinary things, known, and familier, ſuch as were obvious to the ſenſes, as here from a <hi>Pot, water, peices of fleſh, bones,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby the mind &amp; memory are much inlivened, and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger impreſſion made upon the heart, <hi>ch.</hi> 22.18. <hi>all they are braſs and Tin, and Iron, and Lead in the midſt of the Furnace:</hi> and here they were as <hi>fleſh, and bones, in the midſt of the Pot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The judgements of God upon places, makes them Pots, in which hee boiles ſinners.</hi> Now <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was a <hi>Pot</hi> over the fire. The Babyloniſh Forces were round about it, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calamities upon it, multitudes in it, who were like <hi>peices of fleſh,</hi> in a <hi>boiling Pot;</hi> what <hi>boiling</hi> thoughts, fears, cares, diſtractions, diſcontents, were amongſt them? we may judge what <hi>boiling</hi> was therein, by the Armies lying near this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and being in readineſſe to come upon it.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>That God at his pleaſure commands judgements upon places: Set on a Pot, pour water into it:</hi> make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable with Plague, Famine, and Sword; if hee ſpeak the word, the thing muſt bee done; whatever hee calls for, takes place, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was a Paradiſe, muſt now become <hi>a boiling Pot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>That when Gods judgements are abroad, hee meets
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:118926:172"/> with all ſorts of men,</hi> the <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Lean,</hi> the ſtrong and weak, the rich and poor: when the <hi>Pot</hi> is on the fire, God will have the <hi>choice peeces,</hi> and choice ones into it, the <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> the <hi>thighs,</hi> the <hi>choice bones,</hi> Prince, Nobles, men in place, of wealth: as well as the poor and lean ones.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 6 <hi>When God is boiling of ſinners in the fire of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he will boil them to purpoſe. Make it boile well, and let the bones thereof be ſodden in the midſt thereof.</hi> This <hi>Pot</hi> was <hi>boiling</hi> not a few hours, daies, or months, but a year and half, 2 <hi>King</hi> 25.1, 2, 3. So when God made <hi>Samaria,</hi> a <hi>boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pot,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.5. he <hi>boiled</hi> the ſinners in it three years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. God ſo <hi>boiled</hi> them there, and theſe here, that he made the proudeſt and ſtouteſt of them to ſtoop, yea, all of them to become meat to their enemies.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That Cities have their filth and ſcum in them: Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> here is likened to a, <hi>Pot</hi> with the <hi>ſcum</hi> in it. The poor are not the <hi>ſcum</hi> of the City, but the <hi>ſinne and wickedneſſe</hi> of poor and rich that is that <hi>ſcum, Jeruſalem</hi> was full of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16. and 22. tells you, what <hi>ſcum,</hi> and abundance of it was in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> There was much <hi>ſcum</hi> in <hi>Sodome,</hi> much in <hi>Samaria,</hi> much among the Nations, but moſt in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To great Cities, there is a confluence of all ſorts of people, who bring <hi>ſcum</hi> and filth with them, and adde to what they finde there: what <hi>ſcummy</hi> doctrin did the falſe Prophets
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:118926:174"/> teach in <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 23. what <hi>ſcummy</hi> counſel did <hi>Jaaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah</hi> and <hi>Pelatiah</hi> give in that City? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.1, 2. what dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill Gods did <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> entertain? <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.28. <hi>according to the Number of thy Cities, are thy gods, O Judah.</hi> There was no ſinne againſt God or Man, but it was in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And other Cities are not without their <hi>ſcum,</hi> no not this City.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Heavy judgements upon ſinful places do not work out the wickedneſſe is in them. Jeruſalem</hi> was beſiedged, ſuffered <hi>hard things,</hi> and her <hi>ſcum</hi> went not <hi>out</hi> of her, it boiled in, ſhe was the worſe for all thoſe <hi>fiery judgements</hi> God brought upon her, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved, thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction, they have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi> God did ſtrike them with Egyptian and Babyloniſh rods, but there were no tears, no relentings, no returnings, but grew harder and harder, even to a rockiſh hardineſs. <hi>Ahaz</hi> the head of this City, in the time of his diſtreſſe, ſinned the more againſt the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. When <hi>Samaria</hi> was beſiedged by the Syrians, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6. did the <hi>ſcum</hi> of it <hi>boil out?</hi> no, <hi>Jehoram</hi> at that time, ſent to take off <hi>Eliſhaes</hi> head, verſ. 31. and ſaid, hee would wait no longer for the Lord, verſ. 33. His <hi>ſcum</hi> boiled in, and boiled up to a greater height.

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>When judgements prevail not with ſinful places to cleanſe them from their iniquities, God threatens, and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſtroy ſuch places, and that without mercy. Jeruſalem</hi> was as a pot over the fire, her ſcum went not out of her, and what then? <hi>Woe to the bloudy City, bring it out peice by peice, let no lot fall upon it,</hi> becauſe the ſcum wrought not out, the fleſh, the people, muſt bee brought out to <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and the pot bee broken in peices, God ſaid of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jer.</hi> 32.31. <hi>This City hath been to mee as a provocation of mine anger, and of my fury, from the day that they buil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Open impudent ſinning provokes to vengeance, and ſhall bee puniſhed openly.</hi> The 7. and 8. verſes together yeild this obſervation. <hi>Jeruſalem ſhed bloud,</hi> not in a corner, or ſome ſecret place, ſhee had no care to conceal and cover what ſhee did, but <hi>openly</hi> as on the top of a rock, ſhee ſet up ſcaffolds to execute the innocent, this cauſed fury to riſe in the Lord, and haſtened him to take vengeance, and to <hi>puniſh her openly;</hi> hee called for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hee led him to the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cauſed him to ſit down there, and <hi>viſibly</hi> to execute his <hi>vengeance</hi> upon her, ſo that her <hi>puniſhment</hi> was as <hi>open</hi> as her ſinne; ſhee ſinned <hi>as on the top of a rock,</hi> and God ſet her bloud <hi>on the top of a rock.</hi> The beſiedging, taking, and burning of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> was ſo <hi>known, and famous,</hi> as that all the Nations took notice thereof, and made themſelves ſport therewith, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.15, 16. ſhe would not cover her ſin and ſhame, and God would not cover her puniſhment.</p>

God would have purged the old world, but it ſlipt the time of its purging, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man,</hi> they have been warned, counſelled, reproved, convinced by my Spirit, in the Patriarchs, and in their boſomes that hath been labouring to bring them to <hi>repentance,</hi> but they grieve, reſiſt, and vex my Spirit, therefore it ſhall ceaſe to ſtrive any more with them, to do them any good. Let us not preſume upon <hi>hereafters,</hi> that wee will <hi>purge, repent, and turn</hi> to God <hi>hereafter;</hi> thy <hi>hereafter</hi> may bee <hi>too late: Seek the Lord while hee may bee found, call ye upon him while he is near, Iſa.</hi> 55.6.

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Great ſinners do not beleeve judgements threatned, but are apt to ſhift them off, and flatter themſelves with hopes of mercy.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Thoſe profeſſe themſelves Gods People, may bee ſuch ſinners, as that God reſolves their deſtruction, excluding all hope of mercy.

               </p>

               <q>Make no mourning for the dead.</q>
               <p>The Jews were wont to bewail their dead, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24 25. <hi>All Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for Joſiah, Jeremy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> for him, and all the ſinging men and ſinging women. <hi>Abraham mourned</hi> for <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 23.2. they were wont to cry, <hi>Ah my Brother, Ah my Siſter, Jerem.</hi> 22.18. to cut and make themſelves bald in their <hi>Lamentations</hi> for their dead, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.6. which was forbid the <hi>Priests, Levit.</hi> 21.5. though they might <hi>mourn</hi> for their near kindred, <hi>ibid.</hi> v. 23. but <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt <hi>make no mourning,</hi> he muſt not put on Sackcloath, ſhave his head, or the corners of his beard, nor cut his fleſh at all, he is forbid all funeral pompe and expreſſions.</p>

               <p>It was in practice among the Jews, ſometimes to <hi>cover</hi> their heads in their mournings, as being unworthy to ſee the light, or any creatures, and ſometimes to <hi>uncover</hi> them, as not being worthy of any Ornament, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. <hi>David</hi> and thoſe with him, had their heads covered, and went weeping. <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.6. When <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were deſtroyed by fire, and <hi>Aaron</hi> with his remaining Sonnes, had great cauſe to <hi>mourn; Moſes</hi> commands them not to <hi>uncover</hi> their heads, or rend their cloaths, clearly demonſtrating that that was their cuſtome in their mournings. They made <hi>bare</hi> their heads, and laid aſhes or earth upon them, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.10. This <hi>Ezekiel</hi> might not do, hee muſt not throw off his <hi>head tire.</hi> The word is <hi>Peer,</hi> or <hi>Pear,</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>Gloria, ornamentum, decus,</hi> what ever the Prophet did wear upon his head, hee muſt keep it on, and not lay it aſide.</p>
               <q>And put on thy ſhooes upon thy feet.</q>
               <p>In their mournings and funerals they went <hi>bare-foot,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.30. <hi>David</hi> was <hi>bare-foot</hi> when hee went up the aſcent of Mount <hi>Olivet. Antonius Margarita</hi> who of a Jew became Chriſtian, and writ of the Rites of the Jews, ſaith, that the kindred at the death of a friend do tear their garments, eat nothing that day in that houſe, but abroad, that they eat no fleſh, drink no wine, unleſſe it be upon the Sabbath, and that they follow the Hearſe, <hi>nudis pedibus.</hi> To this agrees what <hi>Leo Modena</hi> hath lately commended to the world.

               <q>And cover not thy Lip.</q>
               <p>Another Ceremony the Jews uſed in their mournings, was the <hi>covering of their chin, mouth,</hi> all under the noſe, which is

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Marriage even in Prophets, and men in ſpiritual functions is lawful. Ezekiel</hi> a Prophet and Prieſt, was in that condition. <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the High Prieſt was married, and had no meaner perſon to his wife, than a Kings Daughter, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a great Prophet, and hee had to wife <hi>Zipporah,</hi> Daughter to the Prince of <hi>Midian, Exod.</hi> 2.16.21. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> that Evangelical Prophet, had his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe. which conceived and bare him a Sonne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> the <hi>Seer,</hi> and man of God, had ſonnes who were Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges over <hi>Iſrael, Judges</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. few of the Prophets lived
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:118926:187"/> ſingle lives, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.1. <hi>There cryed a certain woman, of the wives of the Sonnes of the Prophets,</hi> that is, one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wives cryed unto <hi>Eliſha,</hi> which ſhews that their calling did not exclude them from <hi>marriage.</hi> God took ſpecial care about the Prieſts marriage, ordering whom they might <hi>mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and whom not, <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.13, 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.22. Neither was it lawful onely for Prophets and Prieſts to <hi>marry,</hi> but for Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpel alſo, <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf had a <hi>Yoak-fellow, Matth.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. that hee had power to lead about a ſiſter, a <hi>wife,</hi> as well as other Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and <hi>Cephas;</hi> which evidences, that moſt of the Apoſtles had their <hi>wives,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> had not done ill, if he had had his. Its a doctrin ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Devils, to <hi>forbid marriage</hi> to any ſort of men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 3. when <hi>marriage</hi> is honourable in all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Conjugal affection between man and wife is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable and pleaſing unto God. Ezekiels</hi> wife was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his eyes, dear and delightful to him, hee took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and content in her, as husbands ought to do in their wives, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Husbands love your wives, and bee not bitter unto them.</hi> God would have no <hi>waters of Marah,</hi> no <hi>bitter</hi> paſſages to come from husbands, againſt their wives, but altogether and alwaies ſtreams of love, their love to, and delight in their <hi>wives,</hi> ſhould bee not onely at firſt while youth, beauty, and means do laſt, but all the time they are their <hi>wives,</hi> no <hi>bitter</hi> looks, no <hi>bitter</hi> words, no <hi>bitter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but their looks, words, carriages, ſhould bee full of love and ſweetneſſe. God hath therefore not onely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <hi>bitterneſs,</hi> and commanded love, but given direction for the manner, how they ſhould love their wives, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 25. <hi>Husbands love your wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Chriſt loved the Church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all its <hi>ſpots,</hi> wrinckles, blemiſhes, ſincerely, ſpiritu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:118926:188"/> delight in <hi>himſelf.</hi> God would have men ſo love their <hi>wives,</hi> as to honour them whatever objection lies in the way, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. though the wife bee the weaker veſſel, yet ſhee muſt bee honoured, her weakneſſe muſt not hinder her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring; a <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſſe is a veſſel of more honour in the houſe than a braſſe pot. The Husband is to honour his <hi>wife</hi> by making known boſome ſecrets to her, by taking her counſel and advice, by ſpeaking well of her, as his glory and crown, by truſting her, by eſteeming of her above others, and by taking her part againſt all others. If God did not approve of love in Husbands producing ſuch effects, hee would not have ſaid, <hi>Let her breaſts ſatisfy thee at all times, and bee thou raviſhed alwaies with her love, Prov.</hi> 5.19. God would have men abound in their <hi>love</hi> to their <hi>wives,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fall ſhort therein, he bids them <hi>erre</hi> in their love, for ſo is the Hebrew, <hi>Tiſhgeh Tamid, errabis jugiter,</hi> thou ſhalt love thy wife rather too much than too little. And did Husbands conſider beſides Gods command, and Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, how it would further their prayers, prevent temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and honour a married condition, they would love their <hi>wives</hi> more conſcientiouſly, ſincerely, ſpiritually, &amp; ſtrongly.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Our neareſt and deareſt comforts are in the hand of the Lord, to dispoſe of as he pleaſe. Behold I take away from thee the deſire of thine eyes:</hi> I have let thee injoy her thus long, I have continued her with thee many daies and years, but now I take her away, ſhee ſhall abide with thee no longer; a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wife is from the Lord, given by him, hee brought the woman unto <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.22. and as hee gives, hee takes at his <hi>pleaſure,</hi> hee took away <hi>Sarah</hi> from <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 23. <hi>Elijah</hi> from <hi>Eliſhah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3. and <hi>Rachel</hi> from <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 35. Wives, Husbands, Children, Friends, are onely lent us of the Lord for a ſeaſon, and when that ſeaſon is expired, hee takes them to himſelf, wee ſhould therefore in all ſuch caſes look unto the hand of God.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>Bitter and great afflictions are not alwaies arguments of Gods hatred and indignation.

<pb n="366" facs="tcp:118926:189"/> affliction, if wee conſider the <hi>aggravations</hi> were in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Hee was now <hi>in Captivity</hi> among <hi>Babylonians,</hi> where his wife was a ſweet companion and comfort unto him, in the midſt of all the troubles, reproaches, and difficulties he met withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Shee was taken away, not in the common way of men and women, but by a <hi>ſuddain ſtroak,</hi> ſuch ſtroaks go to the quick, wound deep, and might have ſunk our Prophet had not the Lord given him a little notice of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it ſhould bee to <hi>Type out the deſtruction of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and City of Jeruſalem,</hi> that God ſhould ſuddainly ſtrike, and take away his wife thereby, to repreſent the ſuddain ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of them, could not but be grievous to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Hee is <hi>forbidden to mourn, weep, or performe any funerall rites</hi> for her; might hee have ſighed, mourned, wept, that would have eaſed his heart; might hee have uſed the Jewiſh Rites and Cuſtomes at her death and burial, that would have teſtified reſpect and love unto her, but hee might not do either of them.</p>
               <p>So then <hi>by theſe aggravations,</hi> you ſee hee had <hi>no light affliction</hi> upon him, and whatever they were, in them was nothing of <hi>divine hatred</hi> and <hi>indignation. Aaron</hi> was the <hi>Saint</hi> of the Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.16. and him the Lord gave a <hi>bitter Cup</hi> to drink off, hee ſlew two of his Sonnes at once, both the eldeſt. <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.23. and for offering a little kitchin or ſtrange fire, which was not prohibited, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, being the firſt time, and then forbad him and his other Sonnes to mourn for them, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1, 2, 6. Chriſt was more than a Prophet, than a Saint, hee was a Son, the onely begotten, the wel-beloved, yet hee had a <hi>cup</hi> given him to drink, which had more <hi>gall and wormwood</hi> in it, than any, yea, than all the <hi>cups</hi> the Prophets and Saints had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince. <hi>Afflictions</hi> argue not Gods <hi>hatred,</hi> if wee ſay ſo, wee ſhall condemn the generation of the righteous, and falſify the truth, for its ſaid, <hi>whom I love, I rebuke and chaſten, Rev.</hi> 3.19.

               <p>Obſ. 7 <hi>A gratious ſpirit will deny it ſelf, and obey God in difficult caſes, and that ſpeedily too.</hi> No ſooner had God made good his word, in taking away <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wife, but hee did <hi>what the Lord commanded.</hi> Nature prompted him to mourn, to weep for his wife, but hee <hi>denies</hi> the dictates of nature, and is content to ſeem unnatural for God, his credit and love to his wife called upon him to ſhew reſpect unto her dead corps, as others did in that kinde, by funeral Rites, but he prefers <hi>Gods command</hi> before his credit, love, and reſpect to his wife, and is willing to bear the cenſures, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of the people in this Caſe, his wife dyes in the night, and next morning hee appears in his wonted habit and tire, hee ſheds no tears, puts off no ſhooes, covers not his Lip, eats not the bread of men or mourners, ſhews no ſign of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but was in as ſweet and ſettled a poſture, as if there had been no ſtroak in his family, hee was the ſame, his wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, as hee was, ſhee being living; her death that was ſo dear to him, that was ſo ſtrange and ſuddain, that was in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:118926:190"/> ſuch a place, made no alteration in him, and upon this ground, onely becauſe <hi>God had commanded</hi> it ſhould be ſo.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That ſometime mens ſinnes bring them into ſuch ſtreights, that though they have loſt their deareſt comforts, yet they dare not outwardly manifeſt any ſorrow for them.</hi> God would take away the Temple, the Excellency of their ſtrength, the deſire of their eyes, the pitty of their ſouls, their Sonnes and daughters, and they ſhould <hi>not dare to mourn, or weep openly,</hi> but ſhould <hi>ſecretly pine away,</hi> and come to nothing. It was ſad to looſe their deareſt comforts, and more ſad that they might not caſe their hearts by tears, or ſighings, and moſt ſad that they muſt ſhew no reſpect to their dead friends, by any funeral rites. This ſad condition had <hi>Jeremy</hi> told them of, <hi>chap.</hi> 16.6, 7. <hi>Both the great and the ſmall ſhall dye in the land, they ſhall not bee buried, neither ſhall men lament for them, nor cut themſelves, nor make themſelves bald for them, neither ſhall men tear themſelves for them, in mourning, to comfort them for the dead, neither ſhall men give them the cup of conſolation to drink for their Father, or for their Mother;</hi> they ſhould be in ſuch ſtreights, through the fury and violence of their enemies (whom their ſinnes had brought upon them) that they ſhould not dare to <hi>mourn</hi> for their dead, and the great evils upon them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>God may and doth put his own faithful ſervants upon hard and unwonted things, thereby to declare what ſhall bee the condition of the wicked. Thus Ezekiel is to you a ſign:</hi> hee hath had his deareſt comfort taken away by an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtroak, he hath not been ſuffered to mourn or weep there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and why ſo? that hee may bee a <hi>ſign</hi> unto you; you would not bee taught by my doctrin, now you muſt bee taught by my example, <hi>according to all that hee hath done, ſhall yee do.</hi> The things are <hi>harſh and unnatural,</hi> that I have done, but its for your ſakes that I am put upon them, and yee ſhall do as I have. Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was put upon it, to walk naked and bare-foot three years, which was <hi>hard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful,</hi> and why? That hee might bee for a <hi>ſign and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia, Iſa.</hi> 20.3. Some may think God deals ill with his Servants, in putting them upon <hi>harſh, reproachful, unnatural,</hi> ridiculous things: but know, all ſouls are the Lords, and hee may command them what hee pleaſe; they have comfort in their obedience, what ever
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:118926:194"/> men think or ſay of them; when as thoſe, they are made <hi>ſigns</hi> unto, have nothing but bitterneſſe and terrors.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Signes accompliſhed, convince men of the truth, and juſt proceedings of God: When this commeth, yee ſhall know that I am the Lord God,</hi> by the fulfilling what this <hi>ſign</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, yee ſhall bee ſo convinced as to acknowledge <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was a <hi>true ſign,</hi> made ſo by mee, and that I have dealt juſtly with you for your iniquities, in bringing you into ſuch ſtreights, as not to dare to mourn openly for your miſeries; if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> have nothing to object againſt mee, from whom being innocent, I took away the deſire of his eyes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to mourn for her; what can you object againſt me, being ſo guilty as none more?

Since the beginning of the World, hath it been heard, that God was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in any judgement, executed upon the Sonnes of men, as to ſhew no tokens of <hi>Mercy?</hi> when hee drowned the World, hee ſhewed great <hi>mercy</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family; when hee conſumed <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> to aſhes, hee gave <hi>Lot</hi> and his Daughters their lives for a prey; and when hee made <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> here a ſpectacle of his vengeance, hee made, an out-let, and <hi>eſcape,</hi> for ſome; he is a God that <hi>in wrath, remembers mercy,</hi> and doubtleſſe in that great overflowing, and drowning made in the low Countries at this time, as he hath ſhewed much <hi>ſeverity,</hi> ſo he hath not forgotten <hi>mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God at his pleaſure puts ſingular honour upon his faithful ſervants the Prophets.</hi> Hee tells <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that when hee ſhall have accompliſhed what hee had prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyed againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that hee ſhould bee informed thereof, that hee would give ſome or others their lives for a prey, that they might bring him tydings thereof, and ſo lift up his head againſt all his adverſaries, who looked upon, and counted him a falſe Prophet. Herein was great honour put upon the Prophet, <hi>hee that eſcapeth ſhall come unto thee, to cauſe thee to hear it,</hi> &amp;c. So God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured <hi>Abraham,</hi> in telling him what hee was about to do
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:118926:197"/> unto <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?</hi> no, hee is a Prophet, a friend of mine, my faithful ſervant, and hee would not conceal the matter from him, So <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. <hi>The Lord revealeth his ſecrets to his Servants the Prophets,</hi> hee ſends a meſſenger unto them, even his holy Spirit, to acquaint them with what hee is doing, and with what hee hath done; ſo hee ſent an Angel to <hi>Joſeph</hi> to tell him that <hi>Herod</hi> was dead, who ſought the life of the young child, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>God hath his times of ſhutting and opening the mouths of his Prophets. Thou ſhalt ſpeak, and bee no more dumbe:</hi> after this time the Prophet was as a <hi>dumb man</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Jews, becauſe they beleeved not his Propheſies, entertained him not as a Prophet, but ſleighted, mocked, and ſcorned him for thoſe unuſual Paſſages of his, which the Lord put him upon; therefore the Lord took him off from being a Prophet unto them, he had no more word for them; the falſe Prophets went on ſtill, but the true Prophet is ſilenced, mens ſinnes do cauſe the Lord to ſtop <hi>the mouths</hi> of his Prophets; their unbeleef, unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, perverſe conſtructions, they make of what is ſaid and done by them, their hearkening to lies, errors, and vain viſions of falſe Prophets, do diſcourage them and cauſe them to bee <hi>ſilent.</hi> Thus Peoples untoward carriages made <hi>Jeremy</hi> reſolve to bee <hi>ſilent,</hi> and Preach no more in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 20.9. The Prophets then had, and the Prophets now have great diſcouragements, and cauſe enough to bee ſilent, and God may cauſe them to bee as <hi>dumb</hi> unto them, removing them into corners, or taking them away; the peoples ſinnes rob them of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mercies, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.26. <hi>I will make thy Tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou ſhalt be dumbe, and ſhalt not be to them a reprover, for they are a rebellious houſe.</hi> Their ſinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of Propheſy, and made the Prophet <hi>dumb.</hi> Let us look to it, that our ſinnes deprive not us thereof, and make our Prophets <hi>dumbe.</hi> God may in juſtice make them <hi>dumb</hi> to us, and <hi>open their mouths</hi> to others.

The <hi>Ammonites</hi> had an inceſtuous beginning, they came from <hi>Lot</hi> and his younger daughter, who named her Sonne <hi>Ben-Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> who was the Father of the children of <hi>Ammon, Gen.</hi> 19.38. they were bitter and bloudy enemies to the Jews, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.1. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.13. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.3, 4, 6. their countrey was ſtrong, well peopled, and full of Cities, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.24. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.33.</p>

When hee had denounced the judgements of God againſt them, and leſt this Propheſy upon record by ſome <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>Jews,</hi> it might bee convaied unto them. The words, <hi>hear the word of the Lord,</hi> import not, that they ſhould <hi>hear it at that inſtant,</hi> when hee propheſyed, but that they ſhould <hi>in time know</hi> what the minde of the Lord was towards them.

               <q>Becauſe thou ſaidſt, Aha, againſt my Sanctuary, when it was prophaned.</q>

God began with <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> his own People and Family, and then cauſed the cup of his fury to paſs unto all Nations and Kingdomes. So <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> after hee had begun with the Jews, and declared what dreadful judgements God would
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:118926:203"/> bring upon them, hee turns aſide to the Nations, and laies the burden of the Lord upon them, and that in nine Chapters together, from the beginning of the 13. to the end of the 21. judgement oft begins at Gods houſe, as <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. <hi>you onely have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities.</hi> God would begin with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Begin at my ſanctuary,</hi> but hee ends elſewhere, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 75.8. when Gods people have drunk the red wine in the Cup, the wicked muſt drink the dregs, the Cup paſſeth from place to place till all be drunk off <hi>Jerem.</hi> 25.29. <hi>Loe, I begin to bring evil upon the City called by my name, and ſhould yee bee utterly unpuniſhed? ye ſhall not bee unpuniſhed, for I will call for a ſword upon all the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth.</hi> Have I begun with mine own City and People, and do you think to go free? no, the ſword is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to come unto you, if that have eat the fleſh of my Sons and Drunk their bloud, much more ſhall it eat your fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That the Lord takes notice what the waies and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of Nations are towards him and his: Thou ſaidſt Aha, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Sanctuary when it was prophaned, and againſt the Land of Iſrael, when it was deſolate:</hi> All the ſecret conſultings, plottings, revilings, attempts that are againſt the worſhip, waies, and people of God, among Heathens, and Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſpirits are minded by the Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66.7. his eyes behold the Nations, the men of them, their thoughts, words, and waies; when the Nations gathered themſelves together againſt <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſaid, let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon <hi>Sion, Mic.</hi> 4.11. God then looked upon them, and obſerved the workings of their hearts, heads, tongues, and hands; yea, their rage and imaginations hee animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, and the People ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a vain thing?</hi> Hee obſerved how inſultingly the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians carried it againſt his, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 50.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. they rejoyced, they laughed, they ſaid <hi>ſing us one of the ſongs of

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>To laugh at, and inſult over the calamities of others, is a grievous and provoking ſinne: Becauſe thou ſaidſt, Aha, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Sanctuary when it was prophaned, and againſt the Land of Iſrael when it was deſolate, and againſt the houſe of Judah when it went into captivity: Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the Eaſt for a poſſeſſion, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites</hi> inſulted, clapped their hands, ſtamped with their feet, were heartily glad at the ſufferings of the Jews, and vented their ſpight againſt them, therefore God was exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, ſo as to threaten the <hi>Ammonites</hi> ruine, and utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation: They were the Neighbours bordering upon them, they were their confederates in league with the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as the Jews were; they were their half brethren deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from <hi>Lot,</hi> and upon theſe accounts ſhould have ſympathized with the Jews, wept with thoſe that wept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15. been ſenſible of their great adverſities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.3. but they inſulted over them, mocked at them, were deſpightful againſt them, and added coals to the fire, weight to their burdens, and more chains to their bonds. Its not onely an uncharitable, but alſo an inhumane, an unnatural thing to inſult, make ſport, and dominere at the miſeries of others; when there bee warres in a land, fires in Cities, ſhip-wracks at Seas, robberies of houſes, inundations of waters, and many ſuffer grievous things, by ſuch judgements of God, ſhould wee rejoyce thereat, mock and make our ſelves mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Surely, if wee do ſo, wee offend, wee provoke the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Hee that is glad at Calamities ſhall not bee unpuniſhed.</hi> The Hebrew is, <hi>ſhall not bee innocent;</hi> God will deal with him as a perſon deeply guilty, hee that makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Calamities the object of his gladneſſe, ſtirs up God to be the Author of his deſtruction. <hi>Shimei</hi> was glad at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of <hi>David</hi> by his Sonne <hi>Abſolon,</hi> yea, mocked at, and curſed him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7, 8. hee made <hi>Davids</hi> miſery the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his mirth, but this kindled ſuch a fire in the breaſt of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:118926:204"/> the Lord, that it made him return his wickedneſſe upon his head, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.44. and cut him off from the Land of the living. Its an argument of a malicious heart, of an imbitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſpirit, to inſult over the miſeries of others, and mock at their calamities, yea, its an evidence of a wicked man that doth ſo, ſuch are <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Babylonians, Job</hi> 31.29. <hi>If I rejoyced at the deſtruction of him that hated mee, or lift up my ſelf when evil found him. Job</hi> profeſſes hee did not make the miſerie of his enemies matter of muſick, hee had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principle within, then to put him on to ſuch a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So <hi>David,</hi> though the abjects and baſe ones rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in his adverſity, yet hee durſt not do ſo, but when they were ſick, hee put on Sackcloath, hee ſympathized with them, hee humbled his ſoul with faſting, and prayed for them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.13, 14, 15. Of ſuch a ſpirit was <hi>Solomon,</hi> who gives wholeſome Counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart bee glad when he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth.</hi> He that rejoyceth at the miſery of his enemy, wil be ſad at his good, and both are evil. Some the greater evils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls their enemies, the more they rejoyce; if they fall into ſin, reproach, or bitter affliction, they are much gladded at it; but thou that doſt ſo, haſt not onely ſtumbled, but art fallen, both into ſin, and into the diſpleaſure of God, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. is a reaſon, why men ſhould not triumph in the troubles and afflictions of others, leaſt the Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him, and hee turn away his wrath from him; thy ſo-doing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes the Lord, and may cauſe him to turn away his afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand from thine enemy, and to turn it againſt thee. In theſe times this ſin is too much in practice, nations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, rejoycing in the miſeries of one another: but we ſhould further conſider,</p>

In the 15. verſ. there bee ſeveral gradations; 1 They <hi>hated</hi> the Jews. 2 Their <hi>hatred continued,</hi> they would not lay it down, but let it proceed from generation to generation, it was <hi>old hatred,</hi> ſuch as had been in their Fathers, grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, great grand-fathers, and their predeceſſors many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. 3 It was not a <hi>ſecret hatred,</hi> but ſuch as put them upon <hi>revenge, and brake out in action.</hi> 4 Such as was not content with a <hi>few revengeful actions,</hi> but carried them on to <hi>trade</hi> in ſuch actions; <hi>they dealt by revenge,</hi> it was their conſtant practice. 5 Their <hi>Heart</hi> was in the ſame, they were given to it, ſet upon it. 6 Their <hi>hatred</hi> was joyned with <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight,</hi> they did inſult and dominere over the <hi>Jews</hi> in their affliction. And 7 Their <hi>end</hi> was the <hi>deſtroying and root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation; <hi>they took vengeance with a deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart, to deſtroy it for the old hatred.</hi> They neighbouring upon the <hi>Jews</hi> did oft infeſt them, in <hi>Ahaz</hi> daies; they inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the South of <hi>Judah,</hi> took <hi>Beth-ſhemeſh,</hi> and <hi>Ajalon,</hi> and <hi>Gederoth,</hi> and <hi>Shocho</hi> with the villages thereof, and <hi>Timnah</hi> with the villages thereof, <hi>Gimzo</hi> alſo, and the villages thereof,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:118926:215"/> and dwelt there, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.18. their <hi>hatred</hi> to the Jews was implacable and immortal; when <hi>enmity</hi> began once between <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it laſted from age to age. <hi>There was war between Jeroboam and Rhehoboam all their daies,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.30. ſo for <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Baaſha,</hi> there was nothing between them, but acts of <hi>hatred</hi> and hoſtility, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.32.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Thoſe that hate, oppoſe, and evil intreat the people of God, hee will be revenged on, and that ſeverely.</hi> The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> dealt <hi>deſpightfully and revengefully</hi> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore the Lord would <hi>cut them off, execute great vengeance</hi> upon them, and that <hi>with furious rebukes.</hi> Gods people are dear unto him, he that touches them, touches the apple of Gods eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. becauſe the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, dealt injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> with the <hi>Jews,</hi> therefore God laid his vengeance upon them, cut them off, and rooted them out. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over them in their minority, and God drowned them in the bottome of the Red Sea for it. Sooner or later God met with, and plagued all the Nations round about the <hi>Jews,</hi> who dealt <hi>unkindly and deſpightfully</hi> with them. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were called of God to puniſh the <hi>Jews</hi> for their wickedneſſe, but becauſe they carried it <hi>bloudily</hi> and <hi>inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly</hi> againſt the people of God, Ier. 50.11. therefore the Lord <hi>deſtroyed Babylon,</hi> and took <hi>vengeance</hi> on her, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>even vengeance of his temple,</hi> v. 28. God is now at this time <hi>reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the wrongs of his people, done by Anti-Chriſt, and the Anti-Chriſtian party.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That when Gods people are ſeverely dealt with by the Lord for their ſinnes, others do impiouſly and inhumanely ſcoff at, and inſult over them.</hi> When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſackt by the Babylonians, the Tyrians cryed, <hi>Aha (vox gaudentium &amp; inſultantium) ſhee is broken;</hi> So the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> chap. 25.3. they had their <hi>Aha</hi> againſt the Sanctuary, and land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.2. the enemy ſaid, <hi>Aha,</hi> againſt the Jews.

Canaan differed</hi> from all other lands, there dwelt the <hi>living God,</hi> there were the living <hi>waters,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> and means of grace and ſalvation, which other lands had not, that land once flowed with <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual milk and honey,</hi> and was the <hi>glory of all lands, Eze.</hi> 20.6. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Chaldaea,</hi> and the other lands round about, were as <hi>dry and dead</hi> lands unto that, they had gods in them, but they were Idol gods, they had worſhip, but it was falſe Worſhip, they had waters, but they were bitter waters, ſuch as Gods people could not drink, they killed thoſe that drank of them: where Gods name is recorded, his Ordinances ſet up in purity and power, hee worſhipped in Spirit and Truth, there is <hi>life, and the land of the living. David</hi> judged himſelf even among <hi>the dead,</hi> when he was ſhut out from the <hi>people,</hi> preſence, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ordinances of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.2. his ſoul fainted, and he was almoſt gone. Moſt lands are lands of <hi>darkneſſe, drineſs,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> they have neither the light nor waters of life in them. Let us bleſſe God that we are in the <hi>land of the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 6 <hi>Gods people may be deprived of their priviledges and comforts for a ſeaſon, but he will in due time reſtore them to the injoyment of the ſame. I ſhall ſet glory in the land of the living.</hi> Gods <hi>glory,</hi> his people, were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but hee would not looſe nor leave his <hi>glory</hi> there, he brought them back again, and <hi>ſet them in the land of the living,</hi> hee gave them another Temple, all thoſe ordinances and priviledges they had before, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.13. <hi>I will place ſalvation in Sion for Iſrael my glory.</hi>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Nothing humane can protect a ſinful City and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the judgements of God. Tyrus</hi> was as ſtrong a place as the world had, her walls, towers, ſhips, wiſe, ſtrong men, could not do it. <hi>Tyrus</hi> was as rich a place as any under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhee had a multitude of all riches, yet theſe kept her not from being brought into great waters; what power or art of man can keep off the winde from a ſhip, when it is at Sea? Its not in the power of all the Sea-men or Marriners in the world to do it; neither can any number of men, or all men keep off a judgement of God when it is comming upon a ſinfull place. Let us not confide in humane things.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The ruine of Cities and States is chiefly from the Princes and Governours in the ſame. Thy Rowers,</hi> they ſit in the chief places, they <hi>have brought thee into great waters,</hi> they brought War, Famine, deſolation upon <hi>Tyrus. Zedekiah</hi> and his Nobles breaking with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> brought <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into great waters, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſin brought all the plagues upon <hi>Egypt;</hi> when <hi>Governours</hi> are wilful, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, weak, ignorant, careleſſe, given to their luſts and pleaſures, they may quickly overthrow all. <hi>Rhehoboams</hi> folly, cauſed that rent in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as never was made up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>That Cities and States grown rich and renowned, have their periods. Tyrus</hi> was <hi>repleniſhed</hi> with the rarities of the world, ſhee had all excellent things in her, and was very glorious, but what became of her, and all ſhe had? were not her riches, her glory, laid in the Seas in the day of her <hi>ruine,</hi> v. 27. ſhee h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>When the Lord brings his judgements upon ſinfull Cities and States, when he makes great changes in them, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ruines them, then ſome lament, and ſome laugh.</hi> When <hi>Tyrus</hi> was beſiedged, ſtormed, taken, and ruined; then the <hi>Rowers, Marriners,</hi> and <hi>Pilots, cryed, wept, and wailed bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, lamenting her</hi> deſtruction; then the <hi>Merchants laughed,</hi> and hiſſed at her.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, burnt, and nothing left but rubbiſh, and aſhes, then <hi>Jeremy</hi> and many others <hi>lamented greatly,</hi> for the ruine thereof, and then the <hi>Ammonites, Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites, laughed</hi> thereat, as you may ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. ſuch is the condition of humane affairs, and corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, that what is matter of mourning and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to one, becomes matter of rejoycing and inſulting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but wiſdome hath ſaid, <hi>he that is glad at calamities, ſhall not bee unpuniſhed, Prov.</hi> 17.5.</p>

                  </bibl> The word of the Lord came again, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>Being to ſpeak unto the King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> hee mentions his Commiſſion, that <hi>the Lord</hi> ſpake to him, and ſent him, one greater than the King himſelf: Hereby the Prophet made way for himſelf, and his meſſage to have the better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; had hee come of his own head, delivered things from his own ſpirit, hee had rendred himſelf contemptible; what hee had to declare unto the King, and againſt him, was not <hi>humane,</hi> but <hi>Revelation</hi> from the Lord.</p>

                     <hi>2</hi>
                  </bibl> Son of Man.</q>
               <p>The <hi>Son of Man,</hi> muſt utter the words of God. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treaſure is put in earthen veſſels, and makes them honourable; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> though hee were the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> yet herein hee was the ſervant of God. Hee ſent him, and put his own words in his mouth, full of Majeſty, and to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, notwithſtanding his meanneſſe and frailty. This <hi>Son of Man,</hi> is made a <hi>Son of Thunder</hi> againſt a proud and haughty Prince.</p>
               <q>Say unto the Prince of Tyrus.</q>
               <p>Some of the Fathers do make this Prince of <hi>Tyrus</hi> to bee the <hi>Devil:</hi> but they were much miſtaken in ſo conceiting;
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:118926:249"/> for here bee many things which are incompetent to him, eſpecially what is ſaid in the 7, and 8. ver. The words are to bee taken litterally of <hi>Ethbahal,</hi> or <hi>Ithobalus,</hi> who was at that time Prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> unto whom this Propheſy was directed, being in his glory and height; whereas <hi>Satan</hi> was caſt out, and caſt down into greater miſery then here is mentioned long before.</p>
               <q>Thus ſaith the Lord God.</q>
               <p>Prophets being ſubject to the ſame infirmities and paſſions as others bee, are little regarded in the world, eſpecially by Princes. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> therefore muſt not ſpeak his own words, but ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God.</hi> The Hebrew, <hi>Adonai, Jehovah,</hi> are <hi>very ſignificant</hi> words: <hi>Jehovah</hi> imports <hi>Gods being,</hi> and <hi>giving being</hi> unto all things. <hi>Adonai,</hi> his <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting all</hi> in their beings, for its from <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:118926:249"/> were to become a God, and he bluſhed not to ſay it.</p>

               <q>I ſit in the ſeat of God, in the midſt of the Seas.</q>
               <p>As <hi>God</hi> is in the Heavens, which are inacceſſible, none being able to come thither, to wrong or harm him, ſo am I in <hi>Tyrus,</hi> ſeated upon a rock, in the heart, or <hi>midſt of the Seas,</hi> none can come at mee to do mee prejudice, I am without fear, I am in <hi>the Seat of God,</hi> not ſubject to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or power of any Mortall whatſoever. All the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bring preſents unto, and adore mee, I have power, wealth, honour, and all things glorious and delightfull, my <hi>Seat</hi> is no other than the <hi>ſeat of God;</hi> here was the great pride of this Prince, who arrogated to himſelf a Deity, and affected divine honour.</p>
               <q>Yet thou art a man and not God.</q>
               <p>The Hebrew is, <hi>Thou art Adam, and not El,</hi> thou art of earth, and not of heaven, thou art a weak ſinful man, that canſt do nothing for others, or thy ſelf; what thou <hi>El,</hi> the
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:118926:250"/> ſtrong God? no, thou forgets what thou art; hee that is <hi>El</hi> will break thee in peices, like a potters veſſel, and make thee know, thou art <hi>man, and not God,</hi> that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thee, and other men; if they bee infirm, and feeble things, ſubject to changes, ſorrows, ſickneſſes, and death, ſo art thou.</p>
               <q>Though thou ſet thine heart as the heart of God.</q>
               <p>Thou haſt had ſuch thoughts of thy ſtrength, thy glory, thy wiſdome, that thou haſt perſwaded thy ſelf, thou art become a <hi>god,</hi> another <hi>god,</hi> or as <hi>god.</hi> The thoughts of <hi>Gods heart,</hi> are, that hee is ſtrong, glorious, great, and wiſe, and thou takeſt up his thoughts; by <hi>heart,</hi> the thoughts, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and devices of it are meant. This <hi>Prince of Tyrus,</hi> dreamed, that hee was as fit and able to rule in the <hi>Seas,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>heaven,</hi> and that his wiſdome, ſtrength, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, made him as honourable and glorious, as the Lords made him, that hee was invincible, like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>The Lord takes notice of mens hearts, in what frame they are: Thine heart is lifted up:</hi> Men cannot look into the <hi>Heart,</hi> being ſhut up in an houſe of clay, but the eies of the Lord peirceth through our mud walls, and beholds our <hi>hearts</hi> and workings of them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7. the Lord looketh on the <hi>heart,</hi> wee look upon actions, faces, outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, but God looks inward, and fixes the eye upon the heart, and ſo, that hee knows what is in his heart, and how it works, hee underſtands all the thoughts thereof, and the imaginations of thoſe thoughts, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. not onely the rude drought, but what imaginations are thereupon. Hee knows mens inwards exactly, and can tell you whoſe <hi>hearts</hi> are proud, and whoſe are humble, whoſe are froward, and whoſe are meek, whoſe are chaſte, and whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Men know not what themſelves are; thou art wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Daniel:</hi> Thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to bee very wiſe, whereas thou art ignorant, and <hi>fooliſh,</hi> and doſt manifeſt it to the full.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:118926:252"/> It was ſo in him to think himſelf a God, that hee knew every ſecret; hee <hi>did not know himſelf,</hi> that is an hard leſſon.

The doctrin of ſelf-knowledge, is out of practice, men ſtudy to know other men, other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries what news? but are ſtrangers to themſelves: <hi>Hazael</hi> knew not himſelf, when the Prophet told him what ſtrange things hee ſhould do, hee was conceited that ſuch cruelty could not harbour in his nature, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 8.12, 13. the Phariſee <hi>knew not</hi> himſelf, when hee juſtified himſelf ſo above the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. Its the common evil of the world, that men do not <hi>know themſelves,</hi> what in truth they are. <hi>Laodicea knew not</hi> her ſelf, ſhee ſaid ſhee was rich, increaſed with goods, and wanted nothing, ſhee <hi>knew not</hi> that ſhe was wretched, poor, blinde, and naked.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>That ironical ſpeeches are not unwarrantable. Thou art wiſer than Daniel, thou knoweſt all ſecrets:</hi> They have ſome tartneſſe in them, yet are frequently uſed in the word, both by God <hi>himſelf,</hi> and his <hi>holy ſervants.</hi>

Take up a lamentation upon the King of Tyrus:</hi> hee had more <hi>wiſdome, beauty, bleſſing, proſperity,</hi> and <hi>abundance</hi> than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but hee <hi>abuſed</hi> all; his heart was lift up, hee honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not God, with what hee had, and therefore <hi>Ezekiel</hi> muſt <hi>lament;</hi> So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.1. hee muſt lament for the Princes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who <hi>abuſed</hi> their power, places, parts, and bleſſings, they had.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Choice accompliſhments with outward glory and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, are no Arguments of Gods grace, or Gods ſpeciall favour towards men.</hi> Heathens, and the worſt of men have had theſe, the Prince of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> who blaſphemouſly ſaid, he was a god, hee <hi>ſealed up the ſum:</hi> hee was a compleat Prince, he had <hi>choice indowments,</hi> hee was <hi>full of wiſdome, perfect in beauty,</hi> hee had <hi>outward glory</hi> and <hi>greatneſſe</hi> as much as any, hee was <hi>ſeated in a Paradiſe,</hi> hee gliſtered with <hi>Pearles,</hi> and <hi>pretious ſtones,</hi> hee had as <hi>choice Muſick</hi> as was to bee had, yet notwithſtanding all theſe, hee was a <hi>wretched man</hi> under the <hi>curſe</hi> of God, and was to <hi>dye the death of the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed.</hi> What vanity is it therefore to pride our ſelves in any humane excellencies, to ſet our hearts upon, or confide in any outward glory or greatneſſe.</p>

               <p>Here the <hi>Prince of Tyrus</hi> is compared unto an <hi>Angel. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in Scripture are called <hi>Cherubims, Gen.</hi> 3.24 The reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances between him and them, take in theſe particulars.</p>

               <q>Till iniquity was found in thee.</q>
               <p>There were ſome ſinnes in this Prince, which were very provoking.</p>
               <p n="1">1 His <hi>Inſulting at the deſtruction of Jeruſalem,</hi> which you have chap. 26.2. <hi>Tyrus</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>Aha, Shee is broken
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:118926:263"/> that was the gates of the people. Tyrus</hi> that was the King of <hi>Tyrus;</hi> and the people, they <hi>inſulted</hi> over the Jews in their miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His <hi>exceſſive pride in making himſelf a god,</hi> or <hi>as God.</hi> Theſe were <hi>iniquities,</hi> and whilſt he was free from them, he proſpered, his actions were commendable, but when theſe ſprung up and were diſcovered, then the Lord threatned him with deſtruction, and haſtened his ruine. The words are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, <hi>humano more;</hi> as men ſearch and find out things, ſo God is here ſaid to do, his finding out is making known things.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Princes, and men in ſupream power, are honourable,</hi> they are <hi>Cherubs,</hi> or <hi>Cherubims,</hi> next unto God. In whoſe word they have many honourable Titles given them. They are called <hi>ſhields, Hoſ.</hi> 4.18. the word for <hi>Rulers,</hi> is <hi>ſhields</hi> in the Hebrew, and <hi>ſhields of the earth, Pſalm</hi> 47.9. they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the ſtate where they live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.3. they are named <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles</hi> and <hi>Cedars, Pſal.</hi> 82.6. they are termed <hi>gods, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the moſt high,</hi> God ownes them for his children, and calls them Gods, which is an height of honour.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>That Kings and potentates have their places, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and power, that they may bee protectors of the people: Thou art the annointed Cherub that covereth:</hi> hee was on the throne, that hee might ſpread his <hi>wings of protection</hi> over his ſubjects, both at Sea and land.

God is ſorely diſpleaſed, and will deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>That Princes are exalted by God, and depend upon him. I have ſet thee,</hi> ſo its God that <hi>raiſes</hi> them, and <hi>cloaths</hi> them with honour and Majeſty, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>By mee Kings reign, and Princes decree juſtice, by me Princes rule, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, even all the Judges of the earth.</hi> Here is mention of <hi>Kings, Princes, Nobles, Judges,</hi> what <hi>Power</hi> ſoever any, or all of theſe have, the higheſt or ſubordinate, they have from <hi>God,</hi> who is the fountain of all power, as well as of <hi>being;</hi> Hee is Lord of heaven and earth, hee is chief governour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Angels and men, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22.28. and he ſets up in <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> and in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom hee pleaſes. They ſhould conſider who <hi>ſets them up,</hi> on whom they depend, and ſerve him with fear, ruling for the Lord; Which becauſe they do not, they grow proud, inſolent, tyrannical, and therefore the ſame hand that ſet them up, throws them down, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God mindes the places were Princes dwell, and the pompe they live in: Thou waſte upon the holy Mountain of God, thou haſt walked up and down in the midſt of the ſtones of fire:</hi> Thine <hi>habitation</hi> hath been in a <hi>ſtrong fortified City,</hi> thou haſt lived in <hi>great ſtate</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> having thy Pallace gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with <hi>Carbuncles,</hi> and other pretious ſtones, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.39. God took <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Ivory houſe,</hi> which <hi>Ahab</hi> built for his <hi>ſtate. Solomons</hi> houſe, <hi>throne, overlaid with the beſt gold,</hi> his Pompe, and State God obſerved, and cauſed to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, 1 <hi>King,</hi> the 7. and 10. chap. and becauſe great ones pride themſelves in their ſeats, and Palaces, God threatens to ſmite their winter houſes, and their ſummer houſes, and tells them that their ivory houſes ſhall periſh, and their great houſes have an end. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>Princes and States are prosperous and ſucceſſeful in their undertakings, whilſt they are free from iniquities. Thou waſt perfect in thy waies from the day thou waſt created, till ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:118926:264"/> was found:</hi> So long as thou keptſt thy ſelf from unjuſt and wicked acts, thou didſt ſpeed well in all thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes at Sea and Land. The Lord bleſſes Heathen Kings, while they do juſt things. Its righteouſneſſe exalts a Nation, even any Nation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.3, 4. <hi>David</hi> told <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> what was the way for him, and his Kingdome to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.13. hee muſt fulfil the Statutes and judgements of the Lord; and then hee ſhould proſper in all that hee did, and whither ſoever hee turned himſelf, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was <hi>free from iniquities,</hi> unjuſt, and cruel acts, and hear what the Spirit of the Lord ſaith of him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.30. <hi>he proſpered in all his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ob. 6 <hi>Great and grievous ſins may bee in Princes and States undiſcovered, but the Lord will ſearch them out, and make them known: Till iniquity was found in thee.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Tyrus</hi> his ſinne was ſecret, and <hi>hidden</hi> from the world, kept within doors, in his own chamber, Palace, City, or Territories, but the Lord <hi>found it out,</hi> and made <hi>diſcovery</hi> of it to the Prophet, and the Prophet to the world. The great ones of <hi>Judah</hi> thought themſelves innocent, yet God <hi>found the bloud of innocents upon their skirts,</hi> and hee found it not by <hi>ſecret ſearch,</hi> by digging, that is, by taking much pains, to find it out, but ſo ſoon as hee came, hee ſpied it upon their skirts, and made it <hi>known, Jerem.</hi> 2.34. men plot miſchief, do works of darkneſſe, and think they ſhall not bee ſeen, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29, 15. but the Lord <hi>ſees,</hi> will finde it out, and bring it into the light; <hi>David</hi> ſinned in <hi>ſecret,</hi> but the Lord ſaw it, and <hi>proclaimed</hi> it to the world.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 7 <hi>Wickedneſſe blaſts proſperous Princes, and flouriſhing States: Thou waſt perfect in thy waies, till iniquity was found in thee:</hi> That cauſed all to wither. His <hi>exalting himſelf</hi> to bee as God, his <hi>inſulting</hi> over others in their miſery, and his <hi>injuſt actions,</hi> cauſed the Lord to threaten and bring <hi>deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.

When <hi>iniquity</hi> was found in <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> breaking with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what ſaid the Lord, <hi>ſhall hee

Its ſaid of <hi>Jotham</hi> that hee became <hi>mighty,</hi> hee <hi>proſpered greatly,</hi> and what was the cauſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.6. it was becauſe hee <hi>prepared his waies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> or eſtabliſhed them before him; hee lookt to it, that hee did nothing, but what God commanded and approved, hee would not defile his heart or hands with <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> therefore hee grew mighty, and left a flouriſhing Kingdome; But when <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Son came to it, who did <hi>wickedly,</hi> you may ſee how the <hi>Syrians, Iſraelites, Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> and <hi>Tiglath Pilezer,</hi> did waſte and conſume his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. would Princes, Rulers, States, Cities, families, perſons, <hi>proſper,</hi> let them take heed of <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and remember <hi>Malachy</hi> 4.1. <hi>The day commeth that ſhall burn like an Oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly ſhall be as ſtubble: and the day that commeth ſhall burn them up, and leave them neither root nor branch.</hi>

               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>The abundance and glory of outward things, occaſions men to forget God and themſelves: Thine heart was lifted up becauſe of thy beauty:</hi> hee had <hi>abundance</hi> of all things, and they, with the <hi>glory</hi> and beauty of them, ſwelled his heart, made him proud, <hi>forget God,</hi> the giver of them, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who was to give account for them. Its hard to keep the heart in a right frame, when wee are compaſſed about with creature-plenty, <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>beauty.</hi> Pride, diſdain, and violence, are the brats and baſtards of plenty. Its harder for Princes or any to regulate their <hi>spirits</hi> in <hi>proſperity,</hi> than in adverſity. A man under preſſures, is ſeldome puft up with Pride, overcome with luft, drowned in covetouſneſs, overtaken with ſurfeiting, and drunkenneſſe, or tickled with worldly <hi>glory;</hi> all which and many other evils, are incident to them that dwell in the midſt of abundance, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. in their <hi>fulneſſe,</hi> men <hi>forget,</hi> and <hi>forſake God,</hi> when in their adverſity they ſeek and ſue unto him, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek mee early,</hi> or <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.

               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>Mens priding themſelves in an outward glory, doth prejudice them in a greater excellency: Thou haſt corrupted
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:118926:269"/> thy wiſdome becauſe of thy brightneſſe:</hi> his wiſdome was of an higher nature, than all his greatneſſe and glory, than his ſhipping, ſouldiers, buildings pretious ſtones, and whatever other external <hi>excellencies</hi> were in <hi>Tyrus,</hi> but by his pride, in theſe hee marred that. Sin is the ſmoak of the ſoul, and what ſmoak is to the eye of the body, that ſin is to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which being darkened, mens wiſdome is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. If there bee a drop of ink or poyſon, in milke or wine they are corrupted; ſo if ſin, eſpecially <hi>pride</hi> be found in a man, his wiſdome is corrupted, and he will think, ſpeak, and do corruptly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.2. <hi>When Pride commeth, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſhame, but with the lowly is wiſdome.</hi> When men are puffed up with their parts and injoyments, then commeth ſhame: Then they will carry themſelves ſo, as others will bee aſhamed of them, their wiſdome is corrupted, and they do fooliſhly: but when men are low and humble, they are wiſe, and do things commendable; true, ſound, uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiſdome, dwells with the lowly, and is a ſtranger to the proud.</p>
               <p>One ſaith upon theſe words of our Prophet, <hi>That all proud men are fools, their pride hath darkened their fooliſh hearts.</hi> Let us take heed of <hi>priding</hi> our ſelves, in any externals or internals, thereby wee ſhall corrupt our glory, let us bee lowly, ſo ſhall we have wiſdome unſpotted, humble, ſo God will give us more grace <hi>James</hi> 4.6.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Gods aim and end in his judgements, is to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known, what a dreadful, juſt, and holy God he is, and that hee may bee declared by men to bee ſo.</hi> God would deſtroy <hi>Zidon</hi> by peſtilence and warre, that hee might be glorified, and <hi>ſanctified</hi> in her, ſhee would not give glory to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Lord would therefore fetch his <hi>glory</hi> out of her by his <hi>judgements,</hi> and cauſe others ſhould ſee the ſame, to confeſſe him to bee a God of power, juſtice, and holineſſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9.16.

               <p>Some <hi>General obſervations</hi> from hence, that <hi>wicked men</hi> are <hi>thornes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Their acquaintance is not deſirable.</hi> Familiarity with them is dangerous, Prov. 24.1. <hi>Be not envious againſt evil men, neither deſire to bee with them;</hi> be they great, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, eminent, yet if <hi>wicked,</hi> wee ſhould neither <hi>envy</hi> them, nor <hi>affect</hi> their company, and why? <hi>For their heart ſtudieth deſtruction, and their lips talk of miſchief,</hi> they are the <hi>ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> and cannot <hi>cordially cloſe</hi> with the <hi>ſeed of the woman;</hi> there is enmity between their ſeeds, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.4. <hi>The beſt of them is a bryar, the moſt upright is ſharper than a thorne hedge;</hi> if the <hi>beſt</hi> of them bee ſo, what are the <hi>Reſt?</hi> One time or other you will finde them ſo. <hi>David</hi> choſe thoſe for his companions who feared the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.63.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Anſwerable fruit is to bee expected from them.</hi> Thornes and bryars muſt bring forth <hi>fruit</hi> ſuitable to their natures. Some make no difference between men, but will truſt <hi>wicked ones</hi> as ſoon as <hi>godly ones,</hi> but they have been, or may bee deceived; for can <hi>good fruit</hi> grow upon an <hi>ill tree?</hi> Chriſt hath taught us otherwiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.16. <hi>Do men gather grapes of Thornes? &amp;c.</hi> hee makes it an impoſſibility, v. 18. a
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:118926:275"/> corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; wickedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the wicked, its naturall to them to do wickedly, and nothing elſe: fire comes out of brambles, and devoures the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon, Judg.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>It is rather matter of rejoycing than mourning, when wicked men are cut off, and taken away;</hi> They are but thornes &amp; bryars, worthleſſe things, cumbering the ground, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill fruit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.10. <hi>When it goeth well with the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the City rejoyceth, and when the wicked periſh there is ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Unprofitable, hurtful things are taken away; Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gardiners are glad, when the bryars and brambles are pulled up from the corn, flowers, and plants among which they grew. The loſſe of <hi>good men</hi> is a great loſſe, as of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a good King; but the loſſe of <hi>wicked</hi> Kings is no loſſe, its gain to a State, and <hi>matter of rejoycing,</hi> they are great brambles, and there is much a do to pull them up, but being up and periſhing, multitudes <hi>ſhout for joy;</hi> who were ſcratched and oppreſſed by them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Thoſe bee the Lords Deputies and Rulers under him, ſhould ſee to it, that bryars and brambles over-run not all the field and vineyard of God.</hi> They do grow high, great, ſpread, and are like to indanger much if they bee not dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. There bee thornes and bryars in all places. There bee State-<hi>brambles,</hi> Citie-<hi>Thornes,</hi> and Church-<hi>Bryars;</hi> ſuch were in the Church of <hi>Galatia,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth were <hi>cut off, Gal.</hi> 5.12. becauſe they ſcratched and troubled them; and <hi>Davids</hi> reſolution was, to <hi>thruſt away</hi> as <hi>thornes,</hi> all the <hi>Sonnes of Belial,</hi> who troubled the State and City of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.6. and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 101.6. hee ſaith, <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doers from the City of the Lord.</hi> Here was a man after Gods own heart, that would not ſuffer pricking thornes, and grieving bryars.</p>
               <p>Some more <hi>particular obſervations</hi> from the words of the verſ.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>The Church and people of God live amongſt thorns;</hi> They dwell in the midſt of wicked men. All that were round about them were <hi>pricking bryars, and grieving thornes.</hi> The Church is a <hi>Lilly among thornes, Cant.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:118926:275"/> was amidſt heatheniſh Nations; Chriſt and his Apoſtles were among Scribes and Phariſees, whoſe ſpirits were <hi>thorny:</hi> Hence take theſe inferences.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Then <hi>Gods people ought to take heed how they walk.</hi> Men who <hi>live,</hi> and <hi>walk</hi> among <hi>bryars</hi> and <hi>thornes,</hi> had need have their <hi>eyes in their heads,</hi> they may otherwiſe bee quickly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled</hi> in the <hi>bryars,</hi> and miſerably <hi>ſcratched, Matth.</hi> 10.16. bee wiſe as <hi>Serpents, &amp;c.</hi> they live among <hi>thorns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Then it is not ſtrange if Gods people be ſcratched ſomtimes by wicked men,</hi> They will <hi>tear</hi> and <hi>rend</hi> their Names, ſtates, Comforts, peace, priviledges, &amp;c. <hi>David, Jeremy, Paul,</hi> were <hi>ſufficiently ſcratched by ſuch bryars</hi> and <hi>thornes,</hi> who ſo touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, had need be fenced with iron, and the ſtaff of a ſpear.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Then ſee a reaſon why the people of God cannot carry on the work, and things of God with more ſpeed,</hi> they dwell amongſt <hi>thornes;</hi> and when <hi>thornes</hi> are in the way, things move <hi>ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> When <hi>good ſeed</hi> was ſown, the <hi>thornes hindred</hi> the growth of it. When <hi>Joſhuah</hi> went about taking <hi>Ai,</hi> there was <hi>Achan</hi> a great <hi>thorn,</hi> in the way; When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was in the work of the Temple, <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> were <hi>thornes</hi> in the way. The motions of Parliament and Army, were not ſo <hi>ſpeedy,</hi> becauſe they met with <hi>great thornes</hi> and <hi>brambles</hi> in their waies.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The Church and people of God ſhall not alwaies bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong bryars and thornes:</hi> They ſhall have a <hi>time of freedome, There ſhall bee no more a pricking bryar and a grieving thorne, Ezek.</hi> 34.28. <hi>They ſhall no more bee a prey to the Heathen, &amp;c.</hi> this was made <hi>good</hi> to the Jews in <hi>the letter</hi> after their return. The <hi>Nations</hi> which had been <hi>thornes</hi> to them; the Lord <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</hi> This <hi>Promiſe referres</hi> alſo to the <hi>Goſpel times,</hi> the Lord is making way for it now. When enemies have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſtrength, Counſel, are active and ſucceſſeful, then they are <hi>thorny</hi> and <hi>grievous;</hi> but the Lord is <hi>diſ-appointing</hi> his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches enemies, and <hi>conſuming</hi> them as bryars and <hi>Thornes, Iſa.</hi> 27.4.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>matter of Comfort</hi> to the Church, that although ſhee have been <hi>long among bryars, thornes,</hi> and hath been much offended by them, yea, <hi>wounded,</hi> yet there is a <hi>time</hi> ſhe ſhall

               <p>This ſhould <hi>draw out our ſpirits in Prayer</hi> unto the Lord, to <hi>haſten</hi> the time, and that he would make <hi>good</hi> what hee hath promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.13. <hi>Inſtead of the thorn ſhall come up the fir-tree, and inſtead of the bryar ſhall come up the Mirtle-tree.</hi> Let us <hi>Pray earneſtly,</hi> that God would give us <hi>fir-trees</hi> and <hi>mirtle-trees,</hi> in the room of our bryars and thornes. Good Magiſtrates, and good Miniſters, inſtead of thoſe have been no better than <hi>thornes</hi> and <hi>bryars unto us.</hi>

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Wicked men have ill thoughts of Gods people. They ſleight them.</hi> Theſe <hi>Bryars</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> the wicked, round about the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, deſpiſed</hi> them, and <hi>ſcorned</hi> them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.4. <hi>Wee are become a reproach to our neighbours, a ſcorn and deriſion to them that are round about us.

               <p>This people of God, the Jews, were ſcattered into the Eaſtern Countries over ſeveral Provinces of the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and here the Lord promiſeth to <hi>gather them</hi> out ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to return them to their own land.</p>

               <p>Of <hi>Sanctifying</hi> was ſpoken in the 22. v.

<pb n="541" facs="tcp:118926:276"/> a ſtrong hand, then they will ſay, he hath not utterly caſt them off, though hee hath ſeverely puniſhed them.

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Gods people have no fixed, certain habitation in this world, but are ſubject to ſcatterings;</hi> They were <hi>removed</hi> out of their land, carried into <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſo the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. <hi>was ſcattered throughout all the regions of Judaea and Samaria.

               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>When ever Gods people are ſcattered abroad in the world, hee hath a care of them, and will ſanctify his name in bringing them into a ſafe and happy condition;</hi> they ſhall bee brought into <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is, into the <hi>Church</hi> which <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> repreſents.

               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The End of Gods gathering his people out of their ſcattered condition is, that they may ſanctify him, and that hee may be ſanctified by them.</hi> Gods power, faithfulneſſe, and goodneſſe, appear in his <hi>gathering</hi> and <hi>bringing</hi> them out of enemies hands, and ſo way is made for his praiſe and honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that before their enemies.</p>

               <p>The Hebrew word for <hi>Dragon,</hi> is <hi>Tannin,</hi> which <hi>Lamen.</hi> 4.3. is rendred a <hi>Sea-monſter,</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 7.12. <hi>a</hi> whale, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9. a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and ſo here, it notes <hi>monſtrous,</hi> and <hi>great crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in the <hi>Sea</hi> or at <hi>Land,</hi> and according to the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is to bee underſtood of the <hi>Whale, Dragon,</hi> or <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile.</hi> The Septuagint, <hi>Montanus,</hi> Vulgar, <hi>Vatablus,</hi> and our Engliſh, have it <hi>Dragon. Junius, Piſcator,</hi> and <hi>Lavater,</hi> a <hi>great Whale.</hi> Some Interpreters make it the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> which is like a <hi>Dragon</hi> or <hi>Serpent,</hi> and lives in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> fens and waters, chiefly in the river of <hi>Nile,</hi> and may not unfitly bee called the <hi>Whale</hi> or <hi>Dragon</hi> thereof. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is likened unto this <hi>Dragon</hi> or <hi>Crocodile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The <hi>Crocodile</hi> is the <hi>chiefeſt and greateſt of all</hi> that moved in the Egyptian waters, no fiſh, no Serpent, comparable to it, ſo <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the <hi>chiefeſt and greateſt</hi> among all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</p>

               <q>That lyeth in the midſt of his Rivers.</q>
               <p>The Hebrew for <hi>Rivers</hi> is <hi>jeorim,</hi> and notes ſuch as are made by the <hi>Art and help of man,</hi> cut out of ſome great river for to water the land. In <hi>Egypt</hi> they had ſeldome any rain, but cut Rivers out of <hi>Nilus,</hi> by which the land was watered according to that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.10. where <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſaid not to bee like <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they ſowed their ſeed, and watered it with the foot, that is, they digged trenches and little rivers, and ſo watered <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the help of their feet, but <hi>Canaan</hi> was watered from heaven. The <hi>Dragons</hi> or <hi>Crocodiles, lay lurking</hi> in theſe ſecurely, and ſo did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his Kingdom, which was full of artificial Rivers.</p>
               <q>My River is mine own, I have made it for my ſelf.</q>
               <p>The words in the Hebrew ſound thus, <hi>Mihi fluvius meus, &amp; ego feci me, To mee is my River, and I have made my ſelf.</hi> The Septuagint is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Mine are the Rivers, and I have made them:</hi> that is, mine is <hi>Nilus,</hi> and all the aquaeducts, or rivulets, cut out of it; but if wee take the words as they bee in the Original, the ſenſe may bee this, <hi>To mee is my River,</hi> its inſtead of clouds, rain, heaven, God. I have <hi>Nilus,</hi> which makes my land as fruitful, comfortable, and beneficial unto mee, as all thoſe do the lands of others; if they owe ought to them, I owe as much to <hi>Nilus.</hi> If wee take the words as tranſlated, <hi>My River is mine own,</hi> that is, its ſo mine that none can take it from mee, or hinder mee of the benefit of it; here he ſhewed his Pride, Arrogancy, and vain-confidence, for God had in a former <hi>Pharaohs</hi> time, made <hi>Nilus</hi> uſeleſſe unto them in <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 41.55. when the ſeven years famine was, and hee could do it again.</p>
               <p>Thoſe words, <hi>I have made it for my ſelf,</hi> muſt not be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as if hee made <hi>Nilus,</hi> for that had its being and flowings
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:118926:281"/> many hundred years before, and the ſpring of it lay unfound out: but the meaning is; <hi>I have by my power, wiſdome, and induſtry, made it advantagious to my ſelf and people.</hi> I have inriched them and my ſelf thereby, and ſo furniſhed and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Kingdome, by means of it, that I ſhall neither ſtand in need of,<note place="margin">Apriae hec di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur fuiſſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia ne deum quidem ullum poſſe ipſum de regno ſuo deji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere adeo fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſibi ipſi conſtabiliviſſe illud videbatur.

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>God is an open and profeſt enemy unto wicked Kings;</hi> Hee proclaims war againſt them, bee they never ſo great, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am againſt thee Pharaoh King of Egypt.</hi> Few are the Kings which abuſe not their authority, they lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, oppreſſe the people, oppoſe the intereſt of God, and therefore hee is a <hi>declared adverſary</hi> unto them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. You may ſee, what a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Kings the Lord ſends the cup of fury unto, and draws out the ſword againſt; there was ſcarcely one good King at that time upon the face of the earth. God was againſt them all. Its a dreadful thing for any King to have God denounce war againſt him, hee muſt needs bee conquered, and brought to nothing; for God is the Lord of Hoſts, armed with ſuch power and Majeſty as that there is no withſtanding him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.10. <hi>Hee bringeth Princes to nothing;</hi> when they are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hee will not ſpare them, though they bee as <hi>great</hi> as <hi>Whales,</hi> as <hi>Cruel</hi> as <hi>Dragons,</hi> and as <hi>cunning</hi> as <hi>Crocodiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Wicked Kings are reſemblances of Satan. Pharaoh</hi> is here called the <hi>Great Dragon,</hi> and ſo is <hi>Satan, Rev.</hi> 12.9. <hi>The Great Dragon was caſt out, that old Serpent, called the Devil, and Satan. Dragons</hi> are dreadful, ſubtle, and cruel; ſo are <hi>Tyrants,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Devil.</hi> The former <hi>Pharaohs</hi> were <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> and ſo called, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.9. they were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the people of God, ſo are all wicked Kings, ſo is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi> What were all the perſecuting Emperours, but <hi>Dragons?</hi> they were lively repreſentations of the <hi>Devil,</hi> that <hi>Great red Dragon;</hi> and ſo are all that tread in their ſteps.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Princes abounding with outward things, grow ſecure, arrogant, and confident. Pharaoh</hi> lay as a <hi>Dragon in the midſt of his Rivers,</hi> hee was ſecure, fed upon the prey, and ſaid <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly</hi> enough, and with too much <hi>confidence, my River is
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:118926:281"/> mine own:</hi> I have water ſufficient in <hi>Nilus</hi> for the watering of <hi>Egypt,</hi> I need beg no rain of God, let him give his rain to whom hee will, and I am ſo well fortified by my Rivers, that I fear no power to diſpoſſeſs me thereof, I am happy, and who can make mee miſerable? Here you have the <hi>true picture and character</hi> of this <hi>Egyptian Pharaoh,</hi> and in him of all <hi>wicked Kings,</hi> who in their proſperity forgot God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much ſafety to themſelves, and truſt in an arm of fleſh.</p>

               <p>Here beginnes <hi>Gods judgements</hi> upon this confident King. God would deal with him, as men do with ſome great fiſh, when the hook is in his <hi>jaws,</hi> they draw him out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the dry land, where hee dies: So God would by an occaſion, draw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into another land, and with him a great Army of the Egyptians, where they ſhould all periſh. The occaſion was this, as <hi>Junius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it, out of <hi>Herodotus, Adiciam</hi> or <hi>Ariciam</hi> King of the <hi>Lybians,</hi> had put himſelf under the protection of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Cyreneans</hi> had invaded ſome part of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and had ſpoiled King <hi>Aricranes</hi> of his Government, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was provoked to lead out an Army, in <hi>Agrum Cyreniacum,</hi> which was the <hi>hook</hi> God put in his <hi>chaws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word for <hi>Hooks</hi> is <hi>Chachim</hi> from <hi>Choach, a Thorne,</hi> and metaphorically an <hi>hook,</hi> ſuch as men bait to catch fiſh withall, <hi>Job</hi> 41.1. <hi>Canſt thou draw out Leviathan with an hook?</hi> the <hi>whale</hi> was too big to be taken with ſuch an <hi>Hook,</hi> though other fiſhes were not. God had a hook to take and draw out the Egyptian Dragon.</p>

Theſe ſhould <hi>adhere</hi> unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as the <hi>ſcales</hi> do unto a <hi>fiſh.</hi> Hee
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:118926:282"/> had called <hi>Nilus</hi> his River, and its ſaid here, <hi>The fiſh of thy River.</hi> The word for <hi>ſcales</hi> is <hi>kaſkkeſheth</hi> from <hi>kaſhah,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>difficult,</hi> and the radical letters are doubled, <hi>propter vehementem geminationem ſquamarum, which do ſo tenatiouſly cleave together,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Avenarius.</note> that its very hard to pierce them.

Such an one its probable <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had on, and all his people in their armes ſuitable followed him.</p>
               <q>I will bring thee up out of the midſt of thy Rivers.</q>
               <p>Hee thought himſelf ſo ſecure in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as that no danger, no miſchief could befall him. <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſo fenced by nature, having the Sea on one ſide, the vaſt deſert on the other, on the right hand ſuch craggy mountaines, and on the left ſuch Fennes, as that its judged inacceſſible, but however it was in it ſelf, yet God ſaith here, <hi>I will bring thee up out of the midſt of thy Rivers,</hi> I will draw thee out into thine enemies land, and there thou ſhalt fall.</p>

God would bring this proud confident King into the <hi>Cyrenean</hi> wilderneſſe, and there leave him to bee a prey unto the enemy, when hee and his Army were ſpread over the wilderneſſe, then they ſhould be deſerted of God, and left to ſpoil.</p>
               <q>Thee, and all the fiſh of thy Rivers.</q>
               <p>As a <hi>fiſh</hi> drawn out of the <hi>water,</hi> left upon the land, <hi>dies,</hi> and becomes a prey, ſo ſhould the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi>

               <q>
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:118926:282"/>Thou ſhalt fall upon the open fields, thou ſhalt not bee brought together, nor gathered.</q>
               <p>Thine Army ſhall bee ſo <hi>beaten, routed,</hi> and overthrown, as no one part of it ſhall bee joyned to another, there ſhall be no rallying, no recruiting; no <hi>gathering</hi> up for burial, but all ſhall bee meat for the beaſts of the field, and for the fowls of Heaven. Some fiſhes when they are drawn out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are taken up, much uſe is made of them; others are thrown away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.48. but here they were ſo bad, that all ſhould bee thrown to the beaſts, and birds of prey.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>When God is wroth with Princes and people, he makes and takes occaſions to execute his judgements upon them. Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his people, had ſinned greatly againſt God, and hee ſtirred up the <hi>Cyreneans</hi> to invade their neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the <hi>Lybians.</hi> Whereupon, hee and his are drawn out to warre, and fall thereby. He and his thought to live ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but God had hooks to draw them out, and judgements to inflict upon them being ſo drawn out. The Elder <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> daies, having greatly provoked God, by deteining the Jews in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God made an <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by dividing the waters of the red Sea, for him to follow them, and then hee, and his being in the red Sea, took <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to bee avenged on him, by cauſing the waters to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up him and all his hoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. God drew <hi>Zerah,</hi> with his huge hoſt of one thouſand thouſand and three hundred Chariots, out of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> unto <hi>Mareſha,</hi> which was a City in the Tribe of <hi>Judah, Joſhuah</hi> 15.44. and there hee ſmote the Ethiopians, and overthrew them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. God made <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead</hi> an hook to draw out wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> to war againſt the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and when hee was there, hee was ſlain, and his army wholly routed, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. God wants not hooks to draw Leviathans, Dragons, and Crocodiles, out of their holes, fens, or rivers, nor ſwords to peirce them when they are drawn out. Hee had hooks for <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the late King of <hi>Scots,</hi> to draw them into <hi>England,</hi> and judgements to inflict upon them being come
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:118926:283"/> forth, for their iniquities. Let great and ſmall take heed how they offend the Lord, hee hath hooks enough, and can make new if hee want them, to drag ſinners out of their lurking holes, and vials of wrath to poure out upon them, being haled out.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>In thoſe actions men do freely, the wiſe providence of God, acts powerfully, and accompliſheth his deſignes. Pharaoh</hi> and his ſubjects, go out freely to war againſt their enemies, yet God had a hook in their chaws, and drew them toth at work. <hi>Rhehoboam freely</hi> refuſed the counſel of the wiſe men, and <hi>freely</hi> followed the counſel of the young men, yet Gods hand was in theſe actions, his hook was in his chaws, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The cauſe was from the Lord. Rhehoboam</hi> carried on freely his own <hi>deſign,</hi> and God powerfully carried on his, though <hi>Rhehoboam</hi> diſcerned it not, neither aimed at it. God ſent the Aſſyrians againſt the Hypocritical Jews, hee charged him to take the ſpoil, and tread them down like mire in the ſtreets. Hee came freely, though Gods hook were in his noſtrils, hee came to do his own will, not Gods, that hee aimed not at, for hee meant not ſo, his heart did not think ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.6, 7. yet Gods providence over-ruled ſo, that he did the work of God. This is a great myſtery, all wicked men act freely, drive on their own intereſts, yet God pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully moves in theſe actions, brings to paſs, his <hi>own purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and counſells, and that without ſin.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>The Counſels and ſtrength of Princes and Armies, comes to nothing, where God doth not aſſiſt but deſert. I will leave thee thrown into the wilderneſſe, thee and all the fiſh of thy River, thou ſhalt fall. Pharaoh</hi> was a great Dragon, wiſe, and ſubtle, hee had wiſe Counſellors, ſtrong Souldiers, a great Army, but neither their Counſel nor ſtrength ſtood them in ſtead; when God had drawn them into the field, he left them, and they fell. Humane wiſdome and ſtrength, can do nothing without God. <hi>Saul</hi> had a great Army, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were gathered together, to fight againſt the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> but did they prevail? no, they fled, and fell down before their enemies, and what was the reaſon? <hi>Saul</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. <hi>The Lord is departed from mee,</hi> hee is neither with mee, nor mine Army, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> can do nothing againſt
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:118926:283"/> uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> when God had forſaken them. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> had an Army of eight hundred thouſand men mighty men of valor, <hi>Abijah</hi> meets him with an Army of four hundred thouſand, even half ſo many, and ſlew of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Army five hundred thouſand. They were ſtrong men on that ſide, and two to one, yet more fell by an hundred thouſand than <hi>Abijahs</hi> Army conſiſted of. And what was the cauſe hereof? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.3, 12. The cauſe was, God was with them, <hi>Behold God himſelf is with us, for our Captain,</hi> he guides us, and girds us with ſtrength ſaid <hi>Abijah. Jeroboam</hi> by his golden Calves, had driven God from him, ſo then, where God is not, there can bee no ſucceſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.9. by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail; Let men have ſtrong horſes, ſtrong Armes, ſtrong bodies, ſtrong Counſels, ſtrong Armies, ſtrong treaſures, if they have not <hi>El-ſhaddai,</hi> the ſtrong Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God with them, all their ſtrengths will prove weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>wee have</hi> ſeen this made good in our daies moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>God in his juſt judgements brings Princes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who confide in an arme of fleſh, to open ſhame and utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; Thou ſhalt fall in the open fields, thou ſhalt not bee gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor brought together, thou ſhalt lye unburied and be meat for beaſts and fowles.</hi> This Egyptian great Dragon, and all the fiſh of his Rivers were ſuch as God caſt out for naught, and gave to bee meat to Kites, Crowes, Vultures, Dogs, Swine, and wild beaſts, their <hi>ſhame</hi> was open, their <hi>end</hi> was <hi>miſerable. Pharaoh</hi> that intreated the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo cruelly, did not God bring him to <hi>open ſhame,</hi> and his great Army? did hee not drown this Dragon, and all adhered to him in the deeps? did hee not give their Carkaſſes to bee meat to the Sea-Dragons, and Sea-Leviathans? <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> and his Army met with <hi>ſhame,</hi> ſcorn, and miſery enough, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> was buried with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of an Aſſe, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 22.19. that is, hee had no bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, but was caſt out, to <hi>ſhame,</hi> ſcorn, and feeding of birds, and beaſts.</p>

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>Wars and the diſmal effects of them are the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon perfidious Princes. Pharaoh</hi> had deceived the Jews, they <hi>leaned</hi> upon him for help, but hee was a <hi>broken reed</hi> unto them: <hi>Therefore behold I will bring a ſword upon thee, and it ſhall bee ſharpe, I will cut off man and beaſt out of thee:</hi> Thou occaſionedſt my people to bee cut off, through thy <hi>unfaithfulneſſe,</hi> and I will cauſe thee and thine to bee cut off through my <hi>fury.</hi> Warres are dreadful, but they are appointed, ſent, and ordered by God, where-ever they come.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>Such is the efficacy and ſeverity of Gods judgements, as that nothing can ſtand before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſecure againſt them. Egypt</hi> had ſtrong Cities, great Rivers, was well peopled, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in horſes and charets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1. yet the land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> ſhall bee deſolate and waſte. Gods <hi>judgements</hi> would <hi>cut off</hi> man and beaſt, <hi>deſtroy</hi> her Cities, and in effect dry up her <hi>Rivers,</hi> they ſhould bee made uſeleſſe. <hi>Egypt</hi> ſtrugled to defend and ſecure her ſelf, but it availed not, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 46.11. <hi>Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt, in vain ſhalt thou uſe ſo many medicines, for thou ſhalt not bee cured. Egypt</hi> was yet a virgin, unconquered, and ſhee is bid to go to <hi>Gilead,</hi> where the moſt pretious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign balm was, and to take thereof, that is, to uſe the beſt means ſhee could finde out, to prevent her raviſhing and deſtruction, and when ſhee had tryed one means, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, many medicines, all were vain, her wound was incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſhee had dealt deceitfully, with the Jews, and lift up her ſelf againſt the Lord, robbing him of his glory, whilſt

               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Gods judgements are often univerſal and ſweeping.</hi> God would lay <hi>Egypt, univerſally waſte,</hi> and <hi>deſolate,</hi> and that from one border to another, <hi>from the Tower of Syene to Arabia,</hi> within which bounds all <hi>Egypt</hi> was comprehended, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.12. <hi>The ſpoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderneſſe, for the ſword of the Lord ſhall devour from one end of the Land, even to the other end of the Land, no fleſh ſhall have peace;</hi> The Chaldeans were Gods inſtruments, hee put the ſword in their hand, which did eat and devout from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream part of the Land to another, no place ſo ſtrong, ſo ſecret, but the ſword found it out and ſpared neither things nor perſons, the <hi>judgement</hi> was ſo univerſal, that no fleſh had peace, that is, none of the Jewiſh nation, the terror of the ſword was every where, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I have cut off the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: their towers are deſolate, I made their streets waſte, that none paſſeth by: Their Cities are deſtroyed, ſo that there is no man, that there is no inhabitant.</hi> God <hi>ſwept away</hi> from the Heathens, their Towers, their ſtreets, their Cities, their men, expecting his people would have learned to fear him, received inſtruction, and prevented an univerſal judgement at leaſt, v. 7. <hi>but they roſe early and corrupted all their doings,</hi> as Gods <hi>Mercies</hi> had not, ſo his <hi>Judgements</hi> did not do them good: Therefore hee complains thus; <hi>Jerem.</hi> 44.7, 8. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commit ye great evils againſt your ſouls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and ſuckling out of Judah, to leave you none to remain, in that you provoke mee to wrath with the works of your hands;</hi> they put God upon an <hi>univerſal judgement,</hi> by their univerſal wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>That the times of Kingdomes flouriſhings, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes deſolations, are in the hand of God,</hi> hee ſets the <hi>bounds</hi>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:118926:290"/> and <hi>periods,</hi> for their <hi>Prosperity,</hi> and their <hi>Adverſity.</hi> Hee ſaid, <hi>The land of Egypt ſhall bee deſolate,</hi> hee put an end to its glory and greatneſſe, hee ſet the <hi>time</hi> how long it ſhould <hi>proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and when that <hi>time</hi> was come, and it brought to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;</hi> hee determined the <hi>time</hi> how long it ſhould lye in that <hi>deſolate</hi> condition. <hi>It ſhall not bee inhabited forty years:</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it ſhall bee <hi>deſolate forty years, Iſa.</hi> 23.15. <hi>Tyre,</hi> as it had its <hi>time</hi> for <hi>reigning,</hi> ſo its <hi>ſeventy years for ſuffering:</hi> the ſame proportion of years, the Lord allotted unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Judah,</hi> and to diverſe Nations; <hi>Jerem.</hi> 25.11. God put <hi>an end</hi> to their dominion, and determined the time of their ſubjection, which was ſeventy years ſervice unto the King of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of States is in the hand of the Lord, to lengthen and ſhorten at his pleaſure. Some ſtates <hi>flouriſh,</hi> four hundred, ſome five hundred, ſome ſix hundred years, and then they are made <hi>deſolate,</hi> for their forty, their ſeventy years, or more, as ſeems good unto the Lord, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Hee changeth times and ſeaſons,</hi> hee remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Kings from their glory and greatneſſe, and throws them into obſcurity, what time he hath determined for them.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>In time of wars people are driven from their friends, habitations, and countries.</hi> When the <hi>ſword</hi> came upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the Egyptians were ſcattered among the Nations, and <hi>diſperſed</hi> through the Countries. God made uſe of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to declare their own miſery, and his juſtice. Its a ſad thing to bee amongſt ſtrangers, whoſe language is not underſtood; to bee expoſed to the ſcornes, frownes, and harſh uſage of enemies, the ſmoak of ones own country, is better than the fire of another. Many in our late warres, have met with this great evil, and can experimentally tell you, what it is to bee driven out of their own Country and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into forrein ones.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ob. 3 <hi>That God ſometimes deals more favourable with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than with his own people. At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians:</hi> but it was the <hi>end of ſeventy years</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee gathered the Jews out of <hi>Babylon:</hi> his <hi>own people</hi> were thirty years or near upon longer under the Babyloniſh yoak, than the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> There was juſt cauſe for this, Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ſinned worſe than the Heathens, and ſo provoked him above them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Jeruſalem hath changed my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into wickedneſſe more than the Nations, and my ſtatutes more than the Countries round about her,</hi> there were no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near or far off, who did like unto the Jews, they forſook God the fountain of living waters, and truſted in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that great Dragon, and in his rivers of waters.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>Nothing is too hard for God, or can hinder the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his will:</hi> The Egyptians were ſcattered among the nations, here a family and there a family, and that forty years together, ſo mingled with the people of other Countries, that they had well nigh forgotten <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had ſo drunk in the manners and cuſtomes of the places where they lived, that they were naturalized thereunto, they were ſo rooted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations, that it ſeemed impoſſible to pluck them up, and plant them in their own Countries; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe things, ſaith God, <hi>I will gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were ſcattered.</hi> Its like the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, and other Nations that had them, held them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and made advantage of their labours, made laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their flight or departure, and ſtruggled hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, as they of old in <hi>Moſes</hi> daies did to retain the
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:118926:292"/> Jews, but whatever oppoſition was made, or difficulty ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the way, God ſaid, <hi>I will bring again the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Egypt.</hi> Had they bound them all in fetters, laid them in dungeons, ſet guards of ſouldiers to have kept them, all theſe ſhould not have hindered the reduction of them; for as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> acknowledged in his prayer, God rules over all the Kingdomes of the Heathens, and in his hand there is power and might, ſo that none is able to withſtand him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.6. no King, no Counſel, no Countrey, no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, no created power is able to withſtand him. The Jewes who had laien longer in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were like dry bones in the grave without hope, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.11. but God made good his word, hee brought them out with a ſtrong hand, breaking in peices gates of braſs, and cutting inſunder bars of Iron.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 5 <hi>Its the ſame hand, the ſame God, that drives men out of their Countries and comforts, into deep and long afflictions abroad, and brings them back out of the ſame, to injoy their countries and comforts.</hi> God <hi>ſcattered</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> among the Nations, hee threw them forty years into Captivity, and hee <hi>brought</hi> them out again from the Nations, and from their Captivity, into the land of <hi>Pathros,</hi> into the land of their Commerce. God <hi>lead</hi> them out, and hee <hi>brought</hi> them in, hee <hi>afflicted</hi> them, and hee <hi>comforted</hi> them. God conducted them outward and inward; as the loſſe of their Countrey, was a great <hi>affliction</hi> unto them, ſo the repoſſeſſing of it was a greater <hi>conſolation</hi> unto them. God threw the Jews into <hi>Babylon,</hi> thoſe deep and brackiſh waters, they were ſo long pickled in, and he brought them out again to the ſweet waters of the Sanctuary. Long <hi>afflictions</hi> have comfortable <hi>ends,</hi> the Jews ſeventy years ſufferings ended in everlaſting kindneſſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8.</p>

               <q>Neither ſhall it exalt it ſelf any more above the Nations.</q>
               <p>It had got power and <hi>Dominion</hi> over other Nations, the <hi>Pharaohs</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> had <hi>power,</hi> over the land of <hi>Judaea,</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.33, 34, 35. and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but after this it became an <hi>underling,</hi> and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable is mentioned about it in the word of God, here God put a band of iron and braſs, upon this Kingdome to keep it from riſing again; it <hi>ſhall not exalt it ſelf any more above the Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>For I will diminiſh them, that they ſhall not rule over the Nations.</q>
               <p>I will make the Egyptians few, and the Kingdome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The Hebrew for <hi>Diminiſh</hi> is, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>When Kingdomes are ruined, brought to utter deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have lain ſo a long time, God is able to raiſe them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Egypt</hi> was made <hi>deſolate,</hi> from one end to another,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:118926:293"/> man and beaſt cut off, the Egyptians ſcattered into remote parts, yet what ſaith the Lord? <hi>They ſhall be there a Kingdom, Egypt</hi> ſhall bee poſſeſſed again, inhabited, become a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, after forty years <hi>deſolation.</hi> God can raiſe up great ſtructures, out of heapes and <hi>ruines.</hi> When a Kingdome is brought to <hi>aſhes,</hi> the Lord can out of thoſe <hi>aſhes bring</hi> forth another. The Lord cauſes Kingdomes to ceaſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. hee plucks them up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. and hee plants, and builds them up again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.9. <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> lay <hi>waſte</hi> ſeventy years, and then God returned the Jews from <hi>Babylon, built</hi> their City, <hi>planted</hi> their land, made them a people again.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>The wiſe providence of God in reſtoring and ordering of Kingdomes, mingles judgement with mercie:</hi> They ſhould bee a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> but a <hi>baſe Kingdome,</hi> they ſhould want that dignity, power, and Liberty they had formerly: So the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> after <hi>Joſiahs</hi> daies, was <hi>low</hi> and <hi>baſe, Ezek.</hi> 17.6, 14. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadrezzar</hi> kept it under; Its from the Lord, what <hi>condition</hi> Kingdomes ſhall bee in, they ſhall be <hi>honourable</hi> or <hi>baſe,</hi> as he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>Thoſe that lift up themſelves above others, ſhall proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably be brought down beneath others. Egypt exalted</hi> it ſelf <hi>above</hi> the Nations: they were proud, haughty, inſolent, but <hi>Egypt</hi> exceeded them therein, and what came thereof? <hi>it ſhall be the baſeſt of the Kingdomes,</hi> conſider what Kingdomes is baſeſt amongſt them all, and <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall be baſer than that; it as was the <hi>higheſt</hi> in pride, ſo it ſhould be the <hi>loweſt</hi> through baſeneſs, and moſt contemptible. The Lord poures out contempt upon Kingdomes and Kings. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a Son of pride, and did not God drive him out from among men? and make that proud King graze among the beaſts? and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him proportionable to his Pride, and cauſe him to ſay, thoſe that walk in pride he is able to abaſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. and in his time he will abaſe all ſuch, he hath abaſed Kingdomes, Kings, and Potentates in our daies, who ſweld with Pride.

Had hee no particular cauſe, this was cauſe enough, that God ſtirred up his ſpirit to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his judgements upon thoſe had deſperately provoked him.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>That Heatheniſh ſouldiers have undergone very hard things, yea, hazarded their lives to pleaſe their heatheniſh Commanders, and all for a temporall reward: Nebuchadrez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Army ſerved a great ſervice thirteen years together, to lye before a City was hard, their heads were made bald, their ſhoulders were peeled, they laboured hard, carried heavy burdens, they watched, they ſuffered heat and cold, and all this for hope of good plunder in <hi>Tyrus.</hi> If <hi>Heathens</hi> would do and indure ſo much for their <hi>Commander,</hi> who was an Idolater, an enemy to God and his people; how much more ſhould Chriſtians do and indure any thing for Chriſt their King, and heavenly <hi>Commander?</hi> if hee ſay go, wee ſhould go, if come, wee ſhould come, if pluck out your right eye, cut off your right hand, or right foot, we ſhould do ſo; if hee calls us to indure affliction, and ſuffer hard things wee ſhould not ſtick at them, no, though it be the jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parding of our lives; knowing hee hath a ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:118926:298"/> reward for us. Seeing men have done and ſuffered ſo much for heathens, how can wee do or ſuffer too much for Chriſt? <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> had three hundred Souldiers, who would clime a Tower if hee bid them, or throw themſelves from the top of a Tower at his command; what diſhonor will it bee to Chriſt, if his ſouldiers will not do as much at his command, as others have done at their Lords Commands?</p>

Nebuchadrezzar</hi> cauſed his Army to ſerve a great ſervice thirteen years, ſo that their heads, ſhoulders, ſides, were bald, and peeled, and what then? yet had hee no <hi>wages,</hi> nor his Army, they <hi>expected</hi> great matters in <hi>Tyrus,</hi> which was ſo rich, and full of all ſorts of Commodities, but <hi>found nothing</hi> conſiderable, nothing anſwering their <hi>expectation,</hi> or ſufficient to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their charge and ſuffering. This undertaking could not be without millions of money, hopes they had, that <hi>Tyrus</hi> being now the Mart of Nations, would repay them with advantage, but <hi>Tyrus</hi> wealth, was diſperſed, and there was no money in Caſh. Sometimes armies find rich ſpoil, and fat prey in the Towns and Cities they take, and ſometimes they find empty houſes.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 6 <hi>Nations, Lands, Kingdomes, are the Lords, and he diſpoſes of them to whom hee pleaſes. Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar:</hi> Hee would take it from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King thereof, and give it to another. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Lord do any wrong unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> becauſe he was tenant at will, and held upon theſe tearmes, <hi>quam diu ſe bene gereret,</hi> to bee King, while hee carried himſelf well; but hee grew proud, inſolent, and like a Dragon lay in the midſt of his rivers, ſaying, my River is mine, and I have made it for my ſelf; God therefore took away his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from him, and gave it to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> hee looſeth the loines of King, and diſ-miſſeth them from their Kingdomes. Hee rejected <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. and gave his Kingdome to <hi>David, chap.</hi> 16.1.13. hee rent ten Tribes from <hi>Rhehoboam,</hi> and gave them to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 11.31. hee caſt out many Kings, and gave their lands to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadrezzar,

Let not us be troubled, that God hath done ſuch things in our daies.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 7 <hi>God in his holy and wiſe Providence makes uſe of Heathens, or any inſtruments to do his work. Nebuchadrez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> and his Army <hi>wrought</hi> for him, they were his ſervants, hee ſet them on work. though they knew it not. When Armies of Heathens, do plunder Townes, take Cities, lay waſte Kingdomes, they are working for God, they are execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his judgements, though they minde it not. God carries on his work, let inſtruments bee what they will. He can make uſe of the worſt of men, as well as of the beſt. Hee can promote his intereſt by an Army of heathens, as well as by an Army of Chriſtians, and let Armies bee what they will, good or bad, when they are at <hi>work,</hi> they <hi>work</hi> for God: <hi>they wrought for mee,</hi> ſaith God. Its good therefore not to ſtick upon the inſtruments which <hi>work,</hi> but to look at the hand in which they are, how that directs and regulates them, look at him whoſe tooles, whoſe ſervants they are. This will quiet mens ſpirits, and keep their tongues within compaſs.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 8 <hi>The Lord ſuffers not any, no not heathens and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to labour for him in vain.</hi> Hee gave the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all the wealth of it to <hi>Nebuchadrezzar</hi> and his Army, who were the worſt of the Heathen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.24. becauſe they ſerved and wrought for him.

<pb n="586" facs="tcp:118926:299"/> hee gave them habitations, and bleſſed their families.

               <q>Will I cauſe the horn of the houſe of Iſrael to bud forth.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horne</hi> is <hi>proper</hi> to a beaſt, but metaphorically is applied to men, and in holy write ſignifies ſometimes <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> 16 15. <hi>I defiled my horn in the duſt,</hi> what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made mee <hi>glorious, honourable,</hi> and <hi>reſpected</hi> amongſt men, that have I laid aſide, and counted no more of than the Dunghil or duſt I ſit upon. Sometimes <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The rough goat is the King of Grecia, and the great horn that is between his eyes, is the firſt King,</hi> viz. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 132.17. <hi>There will I make the horn of David to bud;</hi> the <hi>Horn of David,</hi> was the <hi>Kingdome of David:</hi> Sometimes <hi>ſtrength, and power, Jerem.</hi> 48.25. <hi>The Horn of Moab is cut off, &amp; his army is broken,</hi> that horn, <hi>of Moab was the ſtrength of Moab, Lam.</hi> 2.3. <hi>He hath cut off in his fierce anger, all the Horn of Iſrael,</hi> that is, <hi>all the ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>power of Iſrael:</hi> Sometimes it notes alſo <hi>outward felicity,</hi> liberty and plenty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.14. <hi>He exalteth the horn of his People,</hi> that is, hee makes them <hi>happy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> hee gives them freedome and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things, and therein <hi>exalt</hi> their <hi>horn.</hi> Here, all theſe ſenſes may bee taken in, God would <hi>make the horn of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> that is, the King and Kingdom to riſe up again to dignity, ſtrength, and happineſſe. This was in part made good in the three children and <hi>Daniel</hi> or when <hi>Jehoiachin</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:118926:300"/> was brought out of Priſon, and his Throne ſet above the Thrones of all the Kings, who were with him in <hi>Babylon, Jeremy</hi> 52.31, 32, 33, 34. then doubtleſſe had the Jews ſome Liberty and Priviledges granted them, which cauſed matter of rejoycing: more fully in <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> when hee brought them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but chiefly in Chriſt, and the Goſpel times. This <hi>Horn</hi> is <hi>budding</hi> ſtill, and ſhall <hi>bud,</hi> to the end of the world. The <hi>Kingdome of Chriſt</hi> ſhall flouriſh and grow ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; as the <hi>Hornes</hi> of a beaſt do yearly.</p>
               <q>I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midſt of them.</q>

               <p>They, referres not onely to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but to the <hi>Babylonians</hi> alſo, when they ſhould ſee the things Propheſied of, done, then they ſhould acknowledge the Lord. The Horn of <hi>Iſrael</hi> budded in the midſt of the Babylonians, and the Prophets mouth was opened in the midſt of them, <hi>therefore</hi> they ſhould as well as the Jews, <hi>know that I am the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſ. 1 <hi>That after the deſtruction of enemies, God ſhews mercy to the Jews:</hi> Egyptians were no friends to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> When <hi>Egypt</hi> therefore ſhould bee ſpoiled, and brought under the Babylonians, then would hee make the Horn of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bud. In that day, or after that time, when his juſtice had fallen upon Egyptians, then his Mercy ſhould bee extended to <hi>Iſrael, Jerem.</hi> 50.4, 5. when the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> ſhould have laid <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> waſte, and made her land deſolate; what then? In thoſe daies, and at that time, ſaith the Lord, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall come, they, and the children of <hi>Judah</hi> together, going and weeping: that is, for glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the mercy vouchſafed them, they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God, they ſhall aske the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> with their faces thitherward. When the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians were brought into bondage, then God gave the Jews their liberty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.26, 27. when the Aſſyrians ſhould bee deſtroyed, then ſhould the Jews bee eaſed of their burdens.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 2 <hi>How low, weak, afflicted, ſoever the Church bee, God is able to raiſe it up, to bring it to glory, ſtrength, and to a flouriſhing condition.</hi> The houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was low, and much afflicted, the Horn of it weak, and hardly viſible, yet God cauſed the Horn thereof to bud; When we look upon ſome beaſts they have no hornes, but in a ſhort time their heads do bud, and bring forth hornes, which are their ſtrength: So God in a little time would cauſe the glory, ſtrength, happineſſe of his Church and People to appear, though at that time they lay in the duſt. The Church of God
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:118926:301"/> looks oft times like a dry and dead tree, but his divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences makes it bud, bloſſome, and flouriſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.1. the deſert ſhall rejoyce and bloſſome, as the roſe, it ſhall bloſſome abundantly. When <hi>Sion</hi> was turned into a wilderneſſe, he made it like <hi>Eden,</hi> and her deſert like the garden of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.3. when the Church was in the moſt deſolate and hopeleſſe condition, hee made it glorious, beautiful, and ſtrong; when the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> was quite fallen, nothing but ruines and breaches diſcernable, what ſaid the Lord, in that day will I raiſe up the Tabernacle of <hi>David</hi> that is fallen, and cloſe up the breaches thereof, and I will raiſe up his ruines, and I will build it. This was done litterally after their return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the ſecond Temple was built, and the two Tribes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> grew up into one body, but ſpiritually in Chriſts time, not in the reſurrection of his body from the grave, but in bringing in the Gentiles after his aſcention to make up all the breaches and ruines were made in the Jewiſh ſtate, ſo its applyed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16. God that gives being to things, that are not, can give more glorious and excellent beings to things that are.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 3 <hi>When God ſhews kindneſſe to his Church, hee gives his Prophets and Servants, matter, freedome, and opportunity of ſpeaking, and profeſſing the true faith publikely.</hi> When the Lord cauſed the horn of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bud, when he ſhewed favour to his people, then hee gave <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the mouth. In the times of enemies prevailing, Prophets are ſilent, or propheſy faintly, if they have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to utter, they want freedome, they whiſper, mutter, and ſpeak as it were <hi>clauſo ore,</hi> and oft have not opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do ſo much, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.13. they are neceſſitated to be ſilent; but when times grow better, and God ſhines upon his people, then the Prophets are full of matter; free to ſpeak, and want not ſeaſons to declare the goodneſſe of God, then they are not afraid or aſhamed openly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Truth, and to praiſe the Lord. The opening of the mouth is the gift of God the illneſſe of the people and times may ſhut the <hi>mouths</hi> of Prophets, but none can open them but God. Since God began to ſhew mercy to his people in this
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:118926:302"/> land, hath he not vouchſafed the opening of the mouth to his Prophets, their mouths were ſhut in the Prelates daies, but now there is a great opening, Bleſſed be the Lord for it.</p>
               <p>Obſ. 4 <hi>The end of Gods ſhewing kindneſſe to his Church, and opening the mouthes of his Prophets, is, that hee may have honour and glory thereby from all ſorts. And they ſhall know that I am the Lord:</hi> They Babylonians, they Jews, ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have done theſe things, and that I am the Lord.</p>
